<h3>PREFACE TO THE SECOND
EDITION.</h3>

  <p>During the two years which have elapsed since the first edition of
  this book appeared, the study of chemical equilibria has been prosecuted
  with considerable activity, and valuable additions have been made to our
  knowledge in several departments of this subject. In view of the scope of
  the present work, it has been, of course, impossible to incorporate all
  that has been done; but several new sections have been inserted, notably
  those on the study of basic salts; the interpretation of cooling curves,
  and the determination of the composition of solid phases without
  analysis; the equilibria between iron, carbon monoxide, and carbon
  dioxide, which are of importance in connection with the processes
  occurring in the blast furnace; and the Phase Rule study of the
  ammonia-soda process. I have also incorporated a short section on the
  reciprocal salt-pair barium carbonate&mdash;potassium sulphate, which had
  been written for the German edition of this book by the late Professor W.
  Meyerhoffer. The section on the iron-carbon alloys, which in the first
  edition was somewhat unsatisfactory, has been rewritten.</p>

<h3>PREFACE</h3>

  <p>Although we are indebted to the late Professor Willard Gibbs for the
  first enunciation of the Phase Rule, it was not till 1887 that its
  practical applicability to the study of Chemical Equilibria was made
  apparent. In that year Roozeboom disclosed the great generalization,
  which for upwards of ten years had remained hidden and unknown save to a
  very few, by stripping from it the garb of abstract Mathematics in which
  it had been clothed by its first discoverer. The Phase Rule was thus made
  generally accessible; and its adoption by Roozeboom as the basis of
  classification of the different cases of chemical equilibrium then known
  established its value, not only as a means of co-ordinating the large
  number of isolated cases of equilibrium and of giving a deeper insight
  into the relationships existing between the different systems, but also
  as a guide in the investigation of unknown systems.</p>

  <p>While the revelation of the principle embedded in the Phase Rule is
  primarily due to Roozeboom, it should not be forgotten that, some years
  previously, van't Hoff, in ignorance of the work of Willard Gibbs, had
  enunciated his "law of the incompatibility of condensed systems," which
  in some respects coincides with the Phase Rule; and it is only owing to
  the more general applicability of the latter that the very <!-- Page ix
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pageix"></a>{ix}</span>important
  generalization of van't Hoff has been somewhat lost sight of.</p>

  <p>The exposition of the Phase Rule and its applications given in the
  following pages has been made entirely non-mathematical, the desire
  having been to explain as clearly as possible the principles underlying
  the Phase Rule, and to illustrate their application to the classification
  and investigation of equilibria, by means of a number of cases actually
  studied. While it has been sought to make the treatment sufficiently
  elementary to be understood by the student just commencing the study of
  chemical equilibria, an attempt has been made to advance his knowledge to
  such a stage as to enable him to study with profit the larger works on
  the subject, and to follow with intelligence the course of investigation
  in this department of Physical Chemistry. It is also hoped that the
  volume may be of use, not only to the student of Physical Chemistry, or
  of the other branches of that science, but also to the student of
  Metallurgy and of Geology, for whom an acquaintance with at least the
  principles of the Phase Rule is becoming increasingly important.</p>

  <p>In writing the following account of the Phase Rule, it is scarcely
  necessary to say that I have been greatly indebted to the larger works on
  Chemical Equilibria by Ostwald ("Lehrbuch"), Roozeboom ("Die Heterogenen
  Gleichgewichte"), and Bancroft ("The Phase Rule"); and in the case of the
  first-named, to the inspiration also of personal teaching. My
  indebtedness to these and other authors I have indicated in the following
  pages.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, I would express my thanks to Sir William Ramsay, whose
  guidance and counsel have been constantly <!-- Page x --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pagex"></a>{x}</span>at my disposal; and to my
  colleagues, Dr. T. Slater Price and Dr. A. McKenzie, for their friendly
  criticism and advice. To Messrs. J. N. Friend, M.Sc., and W. E. S.
  Turner, B.Sc., I am also indebted for their assistance in reading the
  proof-sheets.</p>

<h2>THE PHASE RULE</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<p class="cenhead">INTRODUCTION</p>

  <p><b>General.</b>&mdash;Before proceeding to the more systematic
  treatment of the Phase Rule, it may, perhaps, be not amiss to give first
  a brief forecast of the nature of the subject we are about to study, in
  order that we may gain some idea of what the Phase Rule is, of the kind
  of problem which it enables us to solve, and of the scope of its
  application.</p>

  <p>It has long been known that if water is placed in a closed, exhausted
  space, vapour is given off and a certain pressure is created in the
  enclosing vessel. Thus, when water is placed in the Torricellian vacuum
  of the barometer, the mercury is depressed, and the amount of depression
  increases as the temperature is raised. But, although the pressure of the
  vapour increases as the temperature rises, its value at any given
  temperature is constant, no matter whether the amount of water present or
  the volume of the vapour is great or small; if the pressure on the vapour
  is altered while the temperature is maintained constant, either the water
  or the vapour will ultimately disappear; the former by evaporation, the
  latter by condensation. At any given temperature within certain limits,
  therefore, water and vapour can exist permanently in contact with one
  another&mdash;or, as it is said, be in equilibrium with one
  another&mdash;only when the pressure has a certain definite value. The
  same law of constancy of vapour pressure at a given <!-- Page 2 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page2"></a>{2}</span>temperature, quite
  irrespective of the volumes of liquid and vapour,<a name="NtA1"
  href="#Nt1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> holds good also in the case of alcohol,
  ether, benzene, and other pure liquids. It is, therefore, not unnatural
  to ask the question, Does it hold good for all liquids? Is it valid, for
  example, in the case of solutions?</p>

  <p>We can find the answer to these questions by studying the behaviour of
  a solution&mdash;say, a solution of common salt in water&mdash;when
  placed in the Torricellian vacuum. In this case, also, it is observed
  that the pressure of the vapour increases as the temperature is raised,
  but the pressure is no longer independent of the volume; as the volume
  increases, the pressure slowly diminishes. If, however, solid salt is
  present in contact with the solution, then the pressure again becomes
  constant at constant temperature, even when the volume of the vapour is
  altered. As we see, therefore, solutions do not behave in the same way as
  pure liquids.</p>

  <p>Moreover, on lowering the temperature of water, a point is reached at
  which ice begins to separate out; and if heat be now added to the system
  or withdrawn from it, no change will take place in the temperature or
  vapour pressure of the latter until either the ice or the water has
  disappeared.<a name="NtA2" href="#Nt2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> Ice, water, and
  vapour, therefore, can be in equilibrium with one another only at one
  definite temperature and one definite pressure.</p>

  <p>In the case of a solution of common salt, however, we may have ice in
  contact with the solution at different temperatures and pressures.
  Further, it is possible to have a solution in equilibrium not only with
  anhydrous salt (NaCl), but also with the hydrated salt (NaCl,
  2H<sub>2</sub>O), as well as with ice, and the question, therefore,
  arises: Is it possible to state in a general manner the conditions under
  which such different systems can exist in equilibrium; or to obtain some
  insight <!-- Page 3 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page3"></a>{3}</span>into the relations which exist between pure
  liquids and solutions? As we shall learn, the Phase Rule enables us to
  give an answer to this question.</p>

  <p>The preceding examples belong to the class of so-called "physical"
  equilibria, or equilibria depending on changes in the physical state.
  More than a hundred years ago, however, it was shown by Wenzel and
  Berthollet that "chemical" equilibria can also exist; that chemical
  reactions do not always take place completely in one direction as
  indicated by the usual chemical equation, but that before the reacting
  substances are all used up the reaction ceases, and there is a condition
  of equilibrium between the reacting substances and the products of
  reaction. As an example of this, there may be taken the process of
  lime-burning, which depends on the fact that when calcium carbonate is
  heated, carbon dioxide is given off and quicklime is produced. If the
  carbonate is heated in a closed vessel it will be found, however, not to
  undergo entire decomposition. When the pressure of the carbon dioxide
  reaches a certain value (which is found to depend on the temperature),
  decomposition ceases, and calcium carbonate exists side by side with
  calcium oxide and carbon dioxide. Moreover, at any given temperature the
  pressure is constant and independent of the amount of carbonate or oxide
  present, or of the volume of the gas; <i>nor does the addition of either
  of the products of dissociation, carbon dioxide or calcium oxide, cause
  any change in the equilibrium</i>. Here, then, we see that, although
  there are three different substances present, and although the
  equilibrium is no longer due to physical, but to chemical change, it
  nevertheless obeys the same law as the vapour pressure of a pure volatile
  liquid, such as water.</p>

  <p>It might be supposed, now, that this behaviour would be shown by other
  dissociating substances, <i>e.g.</i> ammonium chloride. When this
  substance is heated it dissociates into ammonia and hydrogen chloride,
  and at any given temperature the pressure of these gases is constant,<a
  name="NtA3" href="#Nt3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> and is independent of the
  amounts of solid and gas present. So far, therefore, ammonium chloride
  behaves like calcium carbonate. If, however, one of the <!-- Page 4
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page4"></a>{4}</span>products of
  dissociation be added to the system, it is found that the pressure is no
  longer constant at a given temperature, but varies with the amount of
  gas, ammonia or hydrogen chloride, which is added. In the case of certain
  dissociating substances, therefore, addition of one of the products of
  dissociation alters the equilibrium, while in other cases it does not.
  With the help of the Phase Rule, however, a general interpretation of
  this difference of behaviour can be given&mdash;an interpretation which
  can be applied not only to the two cases cited, but to all cases of
  dissociation.</p>

  <p>Again, it is well known that sulphur exists in two different
  crystalline forms, octahedral and prismatic, each of which melts at a
  different temperature. The problem here is, therefore, more complicated
  than in the case of ice, for there is now a possibility not only of one
  solid form, but of two different forms of the same substance existing in
  contact with liquid. What are the conditions under which these two forms
  can exist in contact with liquid, either singly or together, and under
  what conditions can the two solid forms exist together without the
  presence of liquid sulphur? To these questions an answer can also be
  given with the help of the Phase Rule.</p>

  <p>These cases are, however, comparatively simple; but when we come, for
  instance, to study the conditions under which solutions are formed, and
  especially when we inquire into the solubility relations of salts capable
  of forming, perhaps, a series of crystalline hydrates; and when we seek
  to determine the conditions under which these different forms can exist
  in contact with the solution, the problem becomes more complicated, and
  the necessity of some general guide to the elucidation of the behaviour
  of these different systems becomes more urgent.</p>

  <p>It is, now, to the study of such physical and chemical equilibria as
  those above-mentioned that the Phase Rule finds application; to the
  study, also, of the conditions regulating, for example, the formation of
  alloys from mixtures of the fused metals, or of the various salts of the
  Stassfurt deposits; the behaviour of iron and carbon in the formation of
  steel and the <!-- Page 5 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page5"></a>{5}</span>separation of different minerals from a fused
  rock-mass.<a name="NtA4" href="#Nt4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> With the help of
  the Phase Rule we can group together into classes the large number of
  different isolated cases of systems in equilibrium; with its aid we are
  able to state, in a general manner at least, the conditions under which a
  system can be in equilibrium, and by its means we can gain some insight
  into the relations existing between different kinds of systems.</p>

  <p><b>Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Equilibrium.</b>&mdash;Before passing
  to the consideration of this generalization, it will be well to first
  make mention of certain restrictions which must be placed on its
  treatment, and also of the limitations to which it is subject. If a
  system is uniform throughout its whole extent, and possesses in every
  part identical physical properties and chemical composition, it is called
  <i>homogeneous</i>. Such is, for example, a solution of sodium chloride
  in water. An equilibrium occurring in such a homogeneous system (such as
  the equilibrium occurring in the formation of an ester in alcoholic
  solution) is called <i>homogeneous equilibrium</i>. If, however, the
  system consists of parts which have different physical properties,
  perhaps also different chemical properties, and which are marked off and
  separated from one another by bounding surfaces, the system is said to be
  <i>heterogeneous</i>. Such a system is formed by ice, water, and vapour,
  in which the three portions, each in itself homogeneous, can be
  mechanically separated from one another. When equilibrium exists between
  different, physically distinct parts, it is known as <i>heterogeneous
  equilibrium</i>. It is, now, with heterogeneous equilibria, with the
  conditions under which a heterogeneous system can exist, that we shall
  deal here.</p>

  <p>Further, we shall not take into account changes of equilibrium due to
  the action of electrical, magnetic, or capillary forces, or of gravity;
  but shall discuss only those which are due to changes of pressure,
  temperature, and volume (or concentration).</p>

  <p><b>Real and Apparent Equilibrium.</b>&mdash;In discussing equilibria,
  also, a distinction must be drawn between real and <!-- Page 6 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page6"></a>{6}</span>apparent equilibria. In the
  former case there is a state of rest which undergoes continuous change
  with change of the conditions (<i>e.g.</i> change of temperature or of
  pressure), and for which the chief criterion is that <i>the same
  condition of equilibrium is reached from whichever side it is
  approached</i>. Thus in the case of a solution, if the temperature is
  maintained constant, the same concentration will be obtained, no matter
  whether we start with an unsaturated solution to which we add more solid,
  or with a supersaturated solution from which we allow solid to
  crystallize out; or, in the case of water in contact with vapour, the
  same vapour pressure will be obtained, no matter whether we heat the
  water up to the given temperature or cool it down from a higher
  temperature. In this case, water and vapour are in <i>real</i>
  equilibrium. On the other hand, water in contact with hydrogen and oxygen
  at the ordinary temperature is a case only of <i>apparent</i>
  equilibrium; on changing the pressure and temperature continuously within
  certain limits there is no continuous change observed in the relative
  amounts of the two gases. On heating beyond these limits there is a
  sudden and not a continuous change, and the system no longer regains its
  former condition on being cooled to the ordinary temperature. In all such
  cases the system may be regarded as undergoing change and as tending
  towards a state of true or real equilibrium, but with such slowness that
  no change is observed.</p>

  <p>Although the case of water in contact with hydrogen and oxygen is an
  extreme one, it must be borne in mind that the condition of true
  equilibrium may not be reached instantaneously or even with measurable
  velocity, and in all cases it is necessary to be on one's guard against
  mistaking apparent (or false) for real (or true) equilibrium. The
  importance of this will be fully illustrated in the sequel.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<p class="cenhead">THE PHASE RULE</p>

  <p>Although the fact that chemical reactions do not take place completely
  in one direction, but proceed only to a certain point and there make a
  halt, was known in the last quarter of the eighteenth century (Wenzel,
  1777; Berthollet, 1799); and although the opening and subsequent decades
  of the following century brought many further examples of such equilibria
  to our knowledge, it was not until the last quarter of the nineteenth
  century that a theorem, general in its application and with foundations
  weakened by no hypothetical assumptions as to the nature or constitution
  of matter, was put forward by Willard Gibbs;<a name="NtA5"
  href="#Nt5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> a generalization which serves at once as a
  golden rule by which the condition of equilibrium of a system can be
  tested, and as a guide to the similarities and dissimilarities existing
  in different systems.</p>

  <p>Before that time, certainly, attempts had been made to bring the
  different known cases of equilibria&mdash;chemical and
  physical&mdash;under general laws. From the very first, both Wenzel<a
  name="NtA6" href="#Nt6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> and Berthollet<a name="NtA7"
  href="#Nt7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> recognized the influence exercised by the
  <i>mass</i> of the substances on the equilibrium of the system. It was
  reserved, however, for Guldberg and Waage, by their more general
  statement and mathematical treatment of the Law of Mass Action,<a
  name="NtA8" href="#Nt8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> to inaugurate the period of
  quantitative study of equilibria. The law which these investigators
  enunciated <!-- Page 8 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page8"></a>{8}</span>served satisfactorily to summarize the
  conditions of equilibrium in many cases both of homogeneous and, with the
  help of certain assumptions and additions, of heterogeneous equilibrium.
  By reason, however, of the fact that it was developed on the basis of the
  kinetic and molecular theories, and involved, therefore, certain
  hypothetical assumptions as to the nature and condition of the substances
  taking part in the equilibrium, the law of mass action failed, as it
  necessarily must, when applied to those systems in which neither the
  number of different molecular aggregates nor the degree of their
  molecular complexity was known.</p>

  <p>Ten years after the law of mass action was propounded by Guldberg and
  Waage, Willard Gibbs,<a name="NtA9" href="#Nt9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>
  Professor of Physics in Yale University, showed how, in a perfectly
  general manner, free from all hypothetical assumptions as to the
  molecular condition of the participating substances, all cases of
  equilibrium could be surveyed and grouped into classes, and how
  similarities in the behaviour of apparently different kinds of systems,
  and differences in apparently similar systems, could be explained.</p>

  <p>As the basis of his theory of equilibria, Gibbs adopted the laws of
  thermodynamics,<a name="NtA10" href="#Nt10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> a method
  of treatment which had first been employed by Horstmann.<a name="NtA11"
  href="#Nt11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> In deducing the law of equilibrium,
  Gibbs regarded a system as possessing only three independently variable
  factors<a name="NtA12"
  href="#Nt12"><sup>[12]</sup></a>&mdash;temperature, pressure, and the
  concentration of the components of the system&mdash;and he enunciated the
  general theorem now usually known as the <i>Phase Rule</i>, by which he
  defined the conditions of equilibrium as a relationship between the
  number of what are called the phases and the components of the
  system.</p>

  <p><b>Phases.</b>&mdash;Before proceeding farther we shall first consider
  what exactly is meant by the terms <i>phase</i> and <i>component</i>. We
  have already seen (p. <a href="#page5">5</a>) that a heterogeneous system
  is made <!-- Page 9 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page9"></a>{9}</span>up of different portions, each in itself
  homogeneous, but marked off in space and separated from the other
  portions by bounding surfaces. These homogeneous, physically distinct and
  mechanically separable portions are called <i>phases</i>. Thus ice,
  water, and vapour, are three phases of the same chemical
  substance&mdash;water. A phase, however, whilst it must be physically and
  chemically homogeneous, need not necessarily be chemically simple. Thus,
  a gaseous mixture or a solution may form a phase; but a heterogeneous
  mixture of solid substances constitutes as many phases as there are
  substances present. Thus when calcium carbonate dissociates under the
  influence of heat, calcium oxide and carbon dioxide are formed. There are
  then <i>two</i> solid phases present, viz. calcium carbonate and oxide,
  and one gas phase, carbon dioxide.</p>

  <p>The <i>number of phases</i> which can exist side by side may vary
  greatly in different systems. In all cases, however, there can be but one
  gas or vapour phase on the account of the fact that all gases are
  miscible with one another in all proportions. In the case of liquid and
  solid phases the number is indefinite, since the above property does not
  apply to them. The number of phases which can be formed by any given
  substance or group of substances also differs greatly, and in general
  increases with the number of participating substances. Even in the case
  of a single substance, however, the number may be considerable; in the
  case of sulphur, for example, at least eight different solid phases are
  known (<i>v.</i> Chap. III.).</p>

  <p>It is of importance to bear in mind that equilibrium is <i>independent
  of the amounts</i> of the phases present.<a name="NtA13"
  href="#Nt13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> Thus it is a familiar fact that the
  pressure of a vapour in contact with a <!-- Page 10 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page10"></a>{10}</span>liquid (<i>i.e.</i> the
  pressure of the saturated vapour) is unaffected by the amounts, whether
  relative or absolute, of the liquid and vapour; also the amount of a
  substance dissolved by a liquid is independent of the amount of solid in
  contact with the solution. It is true that deviations from this general
  law occur when the amount of liquid or the size of the solid particles is
  reduced beyond a certain point,<a name="NtA14"
  href="#Nt14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> owing to the influence of surface
  energy; but we have already (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page5">5</a>) excluded such
  cases from consideration.</p>

  <p><b>Components.</b>&mdash;Although the conception of phases is one
  which is readily understood, somewhat greater difficulty is experienced
  when we come to consider what is meant by the term <i>component</i>; for
  the components of a system are not synonymous with the chemical elements
  or compounds present, <i>i.e.</i> with the <i>constituents</i> of the
  system, although both elements and compounds may be components. By the
  latter term there are meant only those constituents the concentration of
  which can undergo <i>independent</i> variation in the different phases,
  and it is only with these that we are concerned here.<a name="NtA15"
  href="#Nt15"><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

  <p>To understand the meaning of this term we shall consider briefly some
  cases with which the reader will be familiar, and at the outset it must
  be emphasized that the Phase Rule is concerned merely with those
  constituents which take part in the state of real equilibrium (p.&nbsp;<a
  href="#page5">5</a>); for it is only to the final state, not to the
  processes by which that state is reached, that the Phase Rule
  applies.</p>

  <p>Consider now the case of the system water&mdash;vapour or
  ice&mdash;water&mdash;vapour. The number of constituents taking part in
  the equilibrium here is only one, viz. the chemical substance, water.
  Hydrogen and oxygen, the constituents of water, are not to be regarded as
  components, because, in the first place, they are <!-- Page 11 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page11"></a>{11}</span>not present in the system
  in a state of real equilibrium (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page6">6</a>); in the second
  place, they are combined in definite proportions to form water, and their
  amounts, therefore, cannot be varied independently. A variation in the
  amount of hydrogen necessitates a definite variation in the amount of
  oxygen.</p>

  <p>In the case, already referred to, in which hydrogen and oxygen are
  present along with water at the ordinary temperature, we are not dealing
  with a condition of true equilibrium. If, however, the temperature is
  raised to a certain point, a state of true equilibrium between hydrogen,
  oxygen, and water-vapour will be possible. In this case hydrogen and
  oxygen will be components, because now they do take part in the
  equilibrium; also, they need no longer be present in definite
  proportions, but excess of one or the other may be added. Of course, if
  the restriction be arbitrarily made that the free hydrogen and oxygen
  shall be present always and only in the proportions in which they are
  combined to form water, there will be, as before, only one component,
  water. From this, then, we see that a change in the conditions of the
  experiment (in the present case a rise of temperature) may necessitate a
  change in the number of the components.</p>

  <p>It is, however, only in the case of systems of more than one component
  that any difficulty will be found; for only in this case will a choice of
  components be possible. Take, for instance, the dissociation of calcium
  carbonate into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide. At each temperature, as
  we have seen, there is a definite state of equilibrium. When equilibrium
  has been established, there are three different substances
  present&mdash;calcium carbonate, calcium oxide, and carbon dioxide; and
  these are the constituents of the system between which equilibrium
  exists. Now, although these constituents take part in the equilibrium,
  they are not all to be regarded as components, for they are not mutually
  independent. On the contrary, the different phases are related to one
  another, and if two of these are taken, the composition of the third is
  defined by the equation</p>

<p class="cenhead">CaCO<sub>3</sub> = CaO + CO<sub>2</sub></p>

<p><!-- Page 12 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page12"></a>{12}</span></p>

  <p>Now, in deciding the number of components in any given system, not
  only must the constituents chosen be capable of independent variation,
  but a further restriction is imposed, and we obtain the following rule:
  <i>As the components of a system there are to be chosen the</i>
  <b>smallest number</b> <i>of independently variable constituents by means
  of which the composition of each phase participating in the state of
  equilibrium can be expressed in the form of a chemical equation.</i></p>

  <p>Applying this rule to the case under consideration, we see that of the
  three constituents present when the system is in a state of equilibrium,
  only two, as already stated, are independently variable. It will further
  be seen that in order to express the composition of each phase present,
  two of these constituents are necessary. The system is, therefore, one of
  <i>two components</i>, or a system of the second order.</p>

  <p>When, now, we proceed to the actual choice of components, it is
  evident that any two of the constituents can be selected. Thus, if we
  choose as components CaCO<sub>3</sub> and CaO, the composition of each
  phase can be expressed by the following equations:&mdash;</p>

<p class="cenhead">CaCO<sub>3</sub> = CaCO<sub>3</sub> + 0CaO <br />CaO = CaO + 0CaCO<sub>3</sub><br />CO<sub>2</sub> = CaCO<sub>3</sub> - CaO</p>

  <p>As we see, then, both zero and negative quantities of the components
  have been introduced; and similar expressions would be obtained if
  CaCO<sub>3</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> were chosen as components. The matter
  can, however, be simplified and the use of negative quantities avoided if
  CaO and CO<sub>2</sub> are chosen; and it is, therefore, customary to
  select these as the components.</p>

  <p>While it is possible in the case of systems of the second order to
  choose the two components in such a way that the composition of each
  phase can be expressed by positive quantities of these, such a choice is
  not always possible when dealing with systems of a higher order
  (containing three or four components).</p>

  <p>From the example which has just been discussed, it might <!-- Page 13
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page13"></a>{13}</span>appear as if the
  choice of the components was rather arbitrary. On examining the point,
  however, it will be seen that the arbitrariness affects only the
  <i>nature</i>, not the <i>number</i>, of the components; a choice could
  be made with respect to which, not to how many, constituents were to be
  regarded as components. As we shall see presently, however, it is only
  the number, not the nature of the components that is of importance.</p>

  <p>After the discussion of the conditions which the substances chosen as
  components must satisfy, another method may be given by which the number
  of components present in a system can be determined. Suppose a system
  consisting of several phases in equilibrium, and the composition of each
  phase determined by analysis. If each phase present, regarded as a whole,
  has the same composition, the system contains only one component, or is
  of the first order. If two phases must be mixed in suitable quantities in
  order that the composition of a third phase may be obtained, the system
  is one of two components or of the second order; and if three phases are
  necessary to give the composition of a fourth coexisting phase, the
  system is one of three components, or of the third order.<a name="NtA16"
  href="#Nt16"><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Although the examples to be considered in the sequel will afford
  sufficient illustration of the application of the rules given above, one
  case may perhaps be discussed to show the application of the method just
  given for determining the number of components.</p>

  <p>Consider the system consisting of Glauber's salt in equilibrium with
  solution and vapour. If these three phases are analyzed, the composition
  of the solid will be expressed by Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,
  10H<sub>2</sub>O; that of the solution by Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> +
  <i>x</i>H<sub>2</sub>O, while the vapour phase will be H<sub>2</sub>O.
  The system evidently cannot be a one-component system, for the phases
  have not all the same composition. By varying the amounts of two phases,
  however (<i>e.g.</i> Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 10H<sub>2</sub>O and
  H<sub>2</sub>O), the composition of the third phase&mdash;the
  solution&mdash;can be obtained. The system is, therefore, one of <i>two
  components</i>.</p>

  <p>But sodium sulphate can also exist in the anhydrous form and as the
  hydrate Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 7H<sub>2</sub>O. In these cases
  there may <!-- Page 14 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page14"></a>{14}</span>be chosen as components
  Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O, and
  Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 7H<sub>2</sub>O and H<sub>2</sub>O
  respectively. In both cases, therefore, there are two components. But the
  two systems (Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,
  10H<sub>2</sub>O&mdash;H<sub>2</sub>O, and Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,
  7H<sub>2</sub>O&mdash;H<sub>2</sub>O) can be regarded as special cases of
  the system Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>&mdash;H<sub>2</sub>O, and these
  two components will apply to all systems made up of sodium sulphate and
  water, no matter whether the solid phase is anhydrous salt or one of the
  hydrates. In all three cases, of course, the <i>number</i> of components
  is the same; but by choosing Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and
  H<sub>2</sub>O as components, the possible occurrence of negative
  quantities of components in expressing the composition of the phases is
  avoided; and, further, these components apply over a much larger range of
  experimental conditions. Again, therefore, we see that, although the
  number of the components of a system is definite, a certain amount of
  liberty is allowed in the choice of the substances; and we also see that
  the choice will be influenced by the conditions of experiment.</p>

  <p>Summing up, now, we may say&mdash;</p>

  <p>(1) The components are to be chosen from among the constituents which
  are present when the system is in a state of true equilibrium, and which
  take part in that equilibrium.</p>

  <p>(2) As components are to be chosen the <i>smallest number</i> of such
  constituents necessary to express the composition of each phase
  participating in the equilibrium, zero and negative quantities of the
  components being permissible.</p>

  <p>(3) In any given system the <i>number</i> of the components is
  definite, but may alter with alteration of the conditions of experiment.
  A certain freedom of choice, however, is allowed in the (qualitative, not
  quantitative) selection of the components, the choice being influenced by
  considerations of simplicity, suitability, or generality of
  application.<a name="NtA17" href="#Nt17"><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Degree of Freedom. Variability of a System.</b>&mdash;It is well
  known that in dealing with a certain mass of gas or vapour, <i>e.g.</i>
  water vapour, if only one of the independently variable
  factors&mdash;temperature, pressure, and concentration (or
  volume)&mdash;is fixed, the state of the gas or vapour is undefined;
  while occupying the same volume (the concentration, therefore, remaining
  <!-- Page 15 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page15"></a>{15}</span>unchanged), the temperature and the pressure
  may be altered; at a given temperature, a gas can exist under different
  pressures and occupy different volumes, and under any given pressure the
  temperature and volume may vary. If, however, two of the factors are
  arbitrarily fixed, then the third factor can only have a certain definite
  value; at any given values of temperature and pressure a given mass of
  gas can occupy only a definite volume.</p>

  <p>Suppose, however, that the system consists of water in contact with
  vapour. The condition of the system then becomes perfectly defined on
  arbitrarily giving one of the variables a certain value. If the
  temperature is fixed, the pressure under which water and water vapour can
  coexist is also determined; and conversely, if a definite pressure is
  chosen, the temperature is also defined. Water and vapour can coexist
  under a given pressure only at a definite temperature.</p>

  <p>Finally, let the water and vapour be cooled down until ice begins to
  separate out. So soon as the third phase, ice, appears, the state of the
  system as regards temperature and pressure of the vapour is perfectly
  defined, and none of the variables can be arbitrarily changed without
  causing the disappearance of one of the phases, ice, water, or
  vapour.</p>

  <p>We see, therefore, that in the case of some systems two, in other
  cases, only one of the independent variables (temperature, pressure,
  concentration) can be altered without destroying the nature of the
  system; while in other systems, again, these variables have all fixed and
  definite values. We shall therefore define the number of degrees of
  freedom<a name="NtA18" href="#Nt18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> of a system as
  the <i>number of the variable factors, temperature, pressure, and
  concentration of the components, which must be arbitrarily fixed in order
  that the condition of the system may be perfectly defined</i>. From what
  has been said, therefore, we shall describe a gas or vapour as having two
  degrees of freedom; the system water&mdash;vapour as having only one; and
  the system ice&mdash;water&mdash;vapour as having no degrees of freedom.
  We may also speak of the <!-- Page 16 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page16"></a>{16}</span><i>variability</i> or <i>variance</i> of a
  system, and describe a system as being invariant, univariant, bivariant,
  multivariant,<a name="NtA19" href="#Nt19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> according
  as the number of degrees of freedom is nought, one, two, or more than
  two.</p>

  <p>A knowledge of its variability is, therefore, of essential importance
  in studying the condition and behaviour of a system, and it is the great
  merit of the Phase Rule that <i>the state of a system is defined entirely
  by the relation existing between the number of the components and the
  phases present</i>, no account being taken of the molecular complexity of
  the participating substances, nor any assumption made with regard to the
  constitution of matter. It is, further, as we see, quite immaterial
  whether we are dealing with "physical" or "chemical" equilibrium; in
  principle, indeed, no distinction need be drawn between the two classes,
  although it is nevertheless often convenient to make use of the terms, in
  spite of a certain amount of indefiniteness which attaches to
  them&mdash;an indefiniteness, indeed, which attaches equally to the terms
  "physical" and "chemical" process.<a name="NtA20"
  href="#Nt20"><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>The Phase Rule.</b>&mdash;The Phase Rule of Gibbs, which defines
  the condition of equilibrium by the relation between the number of
  coexisting phases and the components, may be stated as follows: A system
  consisting of n components can exist in <i>n</i> + 2 phases only when the
  temperature, pressure, and concentration have fixed and definite values;
  if there are <i>n</i> components in <i>n</i> + 1 phases, equilibrium can
  exist while one of the factors varies, and if there are only <i>n</i>
  phases, two of the varying factors may be arbitrarily fixed. This rule,
  the application of which, it is hoped, will become clear in the sequel,
  may be very concisely and conveniently summarized in the form of the
  equation&mdash;</p>

<p class="cenhead">P + F = C + 2, or F = C + 2 - P</p>

  <p>where P denotes the number of the phases, F the degrees of freedom,
  and C the number of components. From the second form of the equation it
  can be readily seen that the greater the number of the phases, the fewer
  are the degrees of freedom. With increase in the number of the phases,
  therefore, the <!-- Page 17 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page17"></a>{17}</span>condition of the system becomes more and
  more defined, or less and less variable.</p>

  <p><b>Classification of Systems according to the Phase Rule.</b>&mdash;We
  have already learned in the introductory chapter that systems which are
  apparently quite different in character may behave in a very similar
  manner. Thus it was stated that the laws which govern the equilibrium
  between water and its vapour are quite analogous to those which are
  obeyed by the dissociation of calcium carbonate into carbon dioxide and
  calcium oxide; in each case a certain temperature is associated with a
  definite pressure, no matter what the relative or absolute amounts of the
  respective substances are. And other examples were given of systems which
  were apparently similar in character, but which nevertheless behaved in a
  different manner. The relations between the various systems, however,
  become perfectly clear and intelligible in the light of the Phase Rule.
  In the case first mentioned, that of water in equilibrium with its
  vapour, we have one component&mdash;water&mdash;present in two phases,
  <i>i.e.</i> in two physically distinct forms, viz. liquid and vapour.
  According to the Phase Rule, therefore, since C = 1, and P = 2, the
  degree of freedom F is equal to 1 + 2 - 2 = 1; the system possesses one
  degree of freedom, as has already been stated. But in the case of the
  second system mentioned above there are two components, viz. calcium
  oxide and carbon dioxide (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page12">12</a>), and three phases,
  viz. two solid phases, CaO and CaCO<sub>3</sub>, and the gaseous phase,
  CO<sub>2</sub>. The number of degrees of freedom of the system,
  therefore, is 2 + 2 - 3 = 1; this system, therefore, also possesses one
  degree of freedom. We can now understand why these two systems behave in
  a similar manner; both are univariant, or possess only one degree of
  freedom. We shall therefore expect a similar behaviour in the case of all
  univariant systems, no matter how dissimilar the systems may outwardly
  appear. Similarly, all bivariant systems will exhibit analogous
  behaviour; and generally, systems possessing the same degree of freedom
  will show a like behaviour. In accordance with the Phase Rule, therefore,
  we may classify the different systems which may be found into invariant,
  univariant, bivariant, multivariant, <!-- Page 18 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page18"></a>{18}</span>according to the relation
  which obtains between the number of the components and the number of
  coexisting phases; and we shall expect that in each case the members of
  any particular group will exhibit a uniform behaviour. By this means we
  are enabled to obtain an insight into the general behaviour of any
  system, so soon as we have determined the number of the components and
  the number of the coexisting phases.</p>

  <p>The adoption of the Phase Rule for the purposes of classification has
  been of great importance in studying changes in the equilibrium existing
  between different substances; for not only does it render possible the
  grouping together of a large number of isolated phenomena, but the
  guidance it affords has led to the discovery of new substances, has given
  the clue to the conditions under which these substances can exist, and
  has led to the recognition of otherwise unobserved resemblances existing
  between different systems.</p>

  <p><b>Deduction of the Phase Rule.</b>&mdash;In the preceding pages we
  have restricted ourselves to the statement of the Phase Rule, without
  giving any indication of how it has been deduced. At the close of this
  chapter, therefore, the mathematical deduction of the generalization will
  be given, but in brief outline only, the reader being referred to works
  on Thermodynamics for a fuller treatment of the subject.<a name="NtA21"
  href="#Nt21"><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

  <p>All forms of energy can be resolved into two factors, the
  <i>capacity</i> factor and the <i>intensity</i> factor; but for the
  production of equilibrium, only the intensity factor is of importance.
  Thus, if two bodies having the same temperature are brought in contact
  with each other, they will be in equilibrium as regards heat energy, no
  matter what may be the amounts of heat (capacity factor) contained in
  either, because the intensity factor&mdash;the temperature&mdash;is the
  same. But if the temperature of the two bodies is different, <i>i.e.</i>
  if the intensity factor of heat energy is different, the two bodies will
  no longer be in equilibrium; but heat will pass from the hotter to the
  colder until both have the same temperature.</p>

  <p>As with heat energy, so with chemical energy. If we have a substance
  existing in two different states, or in two different <!-- Page 19
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page19"></a>{19}</span>phases of a
  system, equilibrium can occur only when the intensity factor of chemical
  energy is the same. This intensity factor may be called the <i>chemical
  potential</i>; and we can therefore say that a system will be in
  equilibrium when the chemical potential of each component is the same in
  all the phases in which the component occurs. Thus, for example, ice,
  water, and vapour have, at the triple point, the same chemical
  potential.</p>

  <p>The potential of a component in any phase depends not only on the
  composition of the phase, but also on the temperature and the pressure
  (or volume). If, therefore, we have a system of C components existing in
  P phases, then, in order to fix the composition of unit mass of each
  phase, it is necessary to know the masses of (C - 1) components in each
  of the phases. As regards the composition, therefore, each phase
  possesses (C - 1) variables. Since there are P phases, it follows that,
  as regards composition, the whole system possesses P(C - 1) variables.
  Besides these there are, however, two other variables, viz. temperature
  and pressure, so that altogether a system of C components in P phases
  possesses P(C - 1) + 2 variables.</p>

  <p>In order to define the state of the system completely, it will be
  necessary to have as many equations as there are variables. If,
  therefore, there are fewer equations than there are variables, then,
  according to the deficiency in the number of the equations, one or more
  of the variables will have an undefined value; and values must be
  assigned to these variables before the system is entirely defined. The
  number of these undefined values gives us the variability or the degree
  of freedom of the system.</p>

  <p>The equations by which the system is to be defined are obtained from
  the relationship between the potential of a component and the composition
  of the phase, the temperature and the pressure. Further, as has already
  been stated, equilibrium occurs when the potential of each component is
  the same in the different phases in which it is present. If, therefore,
  we choose as standard one of the phases in which all the components
  occur, then in any other phase in equilibrium with <!-- Page 20 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page20"></a>{20}</span>it, the potential of each
  component must be the same as in the standard phase. For each phase in
  equilibrium with the standard phase, therefore, there will be a definite
  equation of state for each component in the phase; so that, if there are
  P phases, we obtain for each component (P - 1) equations; and for C
  components, therefore, we obtain C(P - 1) equations.</p>

  <p>But we have seen above that there are P(C - 1) + 2 variables, and as
  we have only C(P - 1) equations, there must be P(C - 1) + 2 - C(P - 1) =
  C + 2 - P variables undefined. That is to say, the degree of freedom (F)
  of a system consisting of C components in P phases is&mdash;</p>

<p class="cenhead">F = C + 2 - P</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<p class="cenhead">TYPICAL SYSTEMS OF ONE COMPONENT</p>

<p class="cenhead">A. <i>Water.</i></p>

  <p>For the sake of rendering the Phase Rule more readily intelligible,
  and at the same time also for the purpose of obtaining examples by which
  we may illustrate the general behaviour of systems, we shall in this
  chapter examine in detail the behaviour of several well-known systems
  consisting of only one component.</p>

  <p>The most familiar examples of equilibria in a one-component system are
  those furnished by the three phases of water, viz. ice, water, water
  vapour. The system consists of one component, because all three phases
  have the same chemical composition, represented by the formula
  H<sub>2</sub>O. As the criterion of equilibrium we shall choose a
  definite pressure, and shall study the variation of the pressure with the
  temperature; and for the purpose of representing the relationships which
  we obtain we shall employ a temperature-pressure diagram, in which the
  temperatures are measured as abscissæ and the pressures as ordinates. In
  such a diagram invariant systems will be represented by points;
  univariant systems by lines, and bivariant systems by areas.</p>

  <p><b>Equilibrium between Liquid and Vapour. Vaporization
  Curve.</b>&mdash;Consider in the first place the conditions for the
  coexistence of liquid and vapour. According to the Phase Rule (p.&nbsp;<a
  href="#page16">16</a>), a system consisting of one component in two
  phases has one degree of freedom, or is univariant. We should therefore
  expect that it will be possible for liquid water to coexist with water
  vapour at different values of temperature and <!-- Page 22 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page22"></a>{22}</span>pressure, but that if we
  arbitrarily fix one of the variable factors, pressure, temperature, or
  volume (in the case of a given mass of substance), the state of the
  system will then be defined. If we fix, say, the temperature, then the
  pressure will have a definite value; or if we adopt a certain pressure,
  the liquid and vapour can coexist only at a certain definite temperature.
  Each temperature, therefore, will correspond to a definite pressure; and
  if in our diagram we join by a continuous line all the points indicating
  the values of the pressure corresponding to the different temperatures,
  we shall obtain a curve (Fig. 1) representing the variation of the
  pressure with the temperature. This is the curve of vapour pressure, or
  the <i>vaporization curve</i> of water.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:19%;">

      alt="Fig. 1" title="Fig. 1" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 1.</span>
  </div>

  <p>Now, the results of experiment are quite in agreement with the
  requirements of the Phase Rule, and at any given temperature the system
  water&mdash;vapour can exist in equilibrium only under a definite
  pressure.</p>

  <p>The vapour pressure of water at different temperatures has been
  subjected to careful measurement by Magnus,<a name="NtA22"

  values of the vapour pressure from -10° to +100° are those calculated
  from the measurements of Regnault, corrected by the measurements of Wiebe

  <p>The pressure is, of course, independent of the relative or absolute
  volumes of the liquid and vapour; on increasing the volume at constant
  temperature, a certain amount of the liquid will pass into vapour, and
  the pressure will regain its former value. If, however, the pressure be
  permanently maintained at a value different from that corresponding to
  the temperature employed, then either all the liquid will pass into
  vapour, or all the vapour will pass into liquid, and we shall have either
  vapour alone or liquid alone.</p>

  <p><b>Upper Limit of Vaporization Curve.</b>&mdash;On continuing to add
  heat to water contained in a closed vessel, the pressure of the vapour
  will gradually increase. Since with increase of pressure the density of
  the vapour must increase, and since with rise of temperature the density
  of the liquid must decrease, a point will be reached at which the density
  of liquid and vapour become identical; the system ceases to be
  heterogeneous, and passes into one homogeneous phase. The temperature at
  which this occurs is called the <i>critical temperature</i>. To this
  temperature there will, of course, correspond a certain definite
  pressure, called the <i>critical pressure</i>. The curve representing the
  <!-- Page 24 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page24"></a>{24}</span>equilibrium between liquid and vapour must,
  therefore, end abruptly at the critical point. At temperatures above this
  point no pressure, however great, can cause the formation of the liquid
  phase; at temperatures above the critical point the vapour becomes a gas.
  In the case of water, the critical temperature is 364.3°, and the
  critical pressure 194.6 atm.; at the point representing these conditions
  the vapour-pressure curve of water must cease.</p>

  <p><b>Sublimation Curve of Ice.</b>&mdash;Vapour is given off not only by
  liquid water, but also by solid water, or ice. That this is so is
  familiar to every one through the fact that ice or snow, even at
  temperatures below the melting point, gradually disappears in the form of
  vapour. Even at temperatures considerably lower than 0°, the vapour
  pressure of ice, although small, is quite appreciable; and it is
  possible, therefore, to have ice and vapour coexisting in equilibrium.
  When we inquire into the conditions under which such a system can exist,
  we see again that we are dealing with a univariant system&mdash;one
  component existing in two phases&mdash;and that, therefore, just as in
  the case of the system water and vapour, there will be for each
  temperature a certain definite pressure of the vapour, and this pressure
  will be independent of the relative or absolute amounts of the solid or
  vapour present, and will depend solely on the temperature. Further, just
  as in the case of the vapour pressure of water, the condition of
  equilibrium between ice and water vapour will be represented by a line or
  curve showing the change of pressure with the temperature. Such a curve,
  representing the conditions of equilibrium between a solid and its
  vapour, is called a <i>sublimation curve</i>. At temperatures represented
  by any point on this curve, the solid (ice) will sublime or pass into
  vapour without previously fusing. Since ice melts at 0° (<i>vide
  infra</i>), the sublimation curve must end at that temperature.</p>

  <p>The following are the values of the vapour pressure of ice between 0°
  and -50°.<a name="NtA30" href="#Nt30"><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Equilibrium between Ice and Water. Curve of Fusion.</b>&mdash;There
  is still another univariant system of the one component water, the
  existence of which, at definite values of temperature and pressure, the
  Phase Rule allows us to predict. This is the system solid&mdash;liquid.
  Ice on being heated to a certain temperature melts and passes into the
  liquid state; and since this system solid&mdash;liquid is univariant,
  there will be for each temperature a certain definite pressure at which
  ice and water can coexist or be in equilibrium, independently of the
  amounts of the two phases present. Since now the temperature at which the
  solid phase is in equilibrium with the liquid phase is known as the
  melting point or point of fusion of the solid, the curve representing the
  temperatures and pressures at which the solid and liquid are in
  equilibrium will represent the change of the melting point with the
  pressure. Such a curve is called the <i>curve of fusion</i>, or the
  melting-point curve.</p>

  <p>It was not until the middle of the nineteenth century that this
  connection between the pressure and the melting point, or the change of
  the melting point with the pressure, was observed. The first to recognize
  the existence of such a relationship was James Thomson,<a name="NtA31"
  href="#Nt31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> who in 1849 showed that from theoretical
  considerations such a relationship must exist, and predicted that in the
  case of ice the melting point would be lowered by pressure. This
  prediction was fully confirmed by his brother, W. Thomson<a name="NtA32"
  href="#Nt32"><sup>[32]</sup></a> (Lord Kelvin), who found that under a
  pressure <!-- Page 26 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page26"></a>{26}</span>of 8.1 atm. the melting point of ice was
  -0.059°; under a pressure of 16.8 atm. the melting point was -0.129°.</p>

  <p>The experiments which were first made in this connection were more of
  a qualitative nature, but in recent years careful measurements of the
  influence of pressure on the melting point of ice have been made more
  especially by Tammann,<a name="NtA33" href="#Nt33"><sup>[33]</sup></a>
  and the results obtained by him are given in the following table and
  represented graphically in Fig. 2.</p>

  <p>From the numbers in the table and from the figure we see that as the
  pressure is increased the melting point of ice is lowered; but we also
  observe that a very large change of pressure is required in order to
  produce a very small change in the melting point. The curve, therefore,
  is very steep. Increase of pressure by one atmosphere lowers the melting
  point by only 0.0076°,<a name="NtA35" href="#Nt35"><sup>[35]</sup></a> or
  an increase of pressure of 135 atm. is required to produce a lowering of
  the melting point of 1°. We see further that the fusion curve bends
  slightly as the pressure is increased, which signifies that the variation
  of <!-- Page 27 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page27"></a>{27}</span>the melting point with the pressure changes;
  at -15°, when the pressure is 1625 kilogm. per sq. cm., increase of
  pressure by 1 kilogm. per sq. cm. lowers the melting point by 0.012°.
  This curvature of the fusion curve we shall later (Chap. IV.) see to be
  an almost universal phenomenon.</p>

  <p><b>Equilibrium between Ice, Water, and Vapour. The Triple
  Point.</b>&mdash;On examining the vapour-pressure curves of ice and water
  (Fig. 3), we see that at a temperature of about 0° and under a pressure
  of about 4.6 mm. mercury, the two curves cut. At this point liquid water
  and solid ice are each in equilibrium with vapour at the same pressure.
  Since this is so, they must, of course, be in equilibrium <!-- Page 28
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page28"></a>{28}</span>with one
  another, as experiment also shows. At this point, therefore, ice, water,
  and vapour can be in equilibrium, and as there are three phases present,
  the point is called a <i>triple point</i>.<a name="NtA36"
  href="#Nt36"><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The triple point, however, does not lie exactly at 0° C., for this
  temperature is defined as the melting point of ice under atmospheric
  pressure. At the triple point, however, the pressure is equal to the
  vapour pressure of ice and water, and this pressure, as we see from the
  tables on pp. 21 and 23, is very nearly 4.6 mm., or almost 1 atm. less
  than in the previous case. Now, we have just seen that a change of
  pressure of 1 atm. corresponds to a change of the melting point of
  0.0076°; the melting point of ice, therefore, when under the pressure of
  its own vapour, will be very nearly +0.0076°, and the pressure of the
  vapour will be very slightly greater than 4.579 mm., which is the
  pressure at 0° (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page21">21</a>). The difference is, however,
  slight, and may be neglected here. At the temperature, then, of +0.0076°,
  and under a pressure of 4.6 mm. of mercury, ice, water, and vapour will
  be in equilibrium; the point in our diagram representing this particular
  temperature and pressure is, therefore, the triple point of the system
  ice&mdash;water&mdash;vapour.</p>

  <p>Since at the triple point we have three phases of one component, the
  system at this point is invariant&mdash;it possesses no degrees of
  freedom. If the temperature is changed, the system will undergo
  alteration in such a way that one of the phases will disappear, and a
  univariant system will result; if heat be added, ice will melt, and we
  shall have left water and vapour; if heat be abstracted, water will
  freeze, and we shall have left ice and vapour; if, when the temperature
  is altered, the pressure is kept constant, then we shall ultimately
  obtain only one phase (see Chap. IV.).</p>

  <p>The triple point is not only the point of intersection of the
  vaporization and sublimation curves, but it is also the end-point of the
  fusion curve. The fusion curve, as we have seen, is the curve of
  equilibrium between ice and water; and since at the triple point ice and
  water are each in equilibrium with <!-- Page 29 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page29"></a>{29}</span>vapour of the same
  pressure, they must, of course, also be in equilibrium with one
  another.</p>

  <p><b>Bivariant Systems of Water.</b>&mdash;If we examine Fig. 4, we see
  that the curves OA, OB, OC, which represent diagrammatically the
  conditions under which water and vapour, ice and vapour, and water and
  ice are in equilibrium, form the boundaries of three "fields," or areas,
  I., II., III. These areas, now, represent the conditions for the
  existence of the single phases, solid, liquid, and vapour respectively.
  At temperatures and pressures represented by any point in the field I.,
  solid only can exist as a stable phase. Since we have here one component
  in only one phase, the system is bivariant, and at any given temperature,
  therefore, ice can exist under a series of pressures; and under any given
  pressure, at a series of temperatures, these pressures and temperatures
  being limited only by the curves OB, OC. Similarly also with the areas
  II. and III.</p>

  <p>We see, further, that the different areas are the regions of stability
  of the phase common to the two curves by which the area is enclosed.<a
  name="NtA37" href="#Nt37"><sup>[37]</sup></a> Thus, the phase common to
  the two systems <!-- Page 30 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page30"></a>{30}</span>represented by BO (ice and vapour), and OA
  (water and vapour) is the vapour phase; and the area BOA is therefore the
  area of the vapour phase. Similarly, BOC is the area of the ice phase,
  and COA the area of the water phase.</p>

  <p><b>Supercooled Water. Metastable State.</b>&mdash;When heated under
  the ordinary atmospheric pressure, ice melts when the temperature reaches
  0°, and it has so far not been found possible to raise the temperature of
  ice above this point without liquefaction taking place. On the other
  hand, it has long been known that water can be cooled below zero without
  solidification occurring. This was first discovered in 1724 by
  Fahrenheit,<a name="NtA38" href="#Nt38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> who found
  that water could be exposed to a temperature of -9.4° without
  solidifying; so soon, however, as a small particle of ice was brought in
  contact with the water, crystallization commenced. Superfused or
  supercooled water&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> water cooled below 0°&mdash;is
  unstable only in respect of the solid phase; so long as the presence of
  the solid phase is carefully avoided, the water can be kept for any
  length of time without solidifying, and the system supercooled water and
  vapour behaves in every way like a stable system. A system, now, which in
  itself is stable, and which becomes instable only in contact with a
  particular phase, is said to be <i>metastable</i>, and the region
  throughout which this condition exists is called the metastable region.
  Supercooled water, therefore, is in a metastable condition. If the
  supercooling be carried below a certain temperature, solidification takes
  place spontaneously without the addition of the solid phase; the system
  then ceases to be metastable, and becomes <i>instable</i>.</p>

  <p>Not only has water been cooled to temperatures considerably below the
  melting point of ice, but the vapour pressure of the supercooled water
  has been measured. It is of interest and importance, now, to see what
  relationship exists between the vapour pressure of ice and that of
  supercooled water at the same temperature. This relationship is clearly
  shown by the numbers in the following table,<a name="NtA39"
  href="#Nt39"><sup>[39]</sup></a> and is represented in Fig. 3, <!-- Page
  31 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page31"></a>{31}</span><span

  pressures of supercooled water being represented by the curve OA&prime;,
  which is the unbroken continuation of AO.</p>

  <p>At all temperatures below 0° (more correctly +0.0076°), at which
  temperature water and ice have the same vapour pressure, the vapour
  pressure of supercooled water is <i>greater</i> than that of ice at the
  same temperature.</p>

  <p>From the relative positions of the curves OB and OA (Fig. 4) we see
  that at all temperatures above 0°, the (metastable) sublimation curve of
  ice, if it could be obtained, would be higher than the vaporization curve
  of water. This shows, therefore, that at 0° a "break" must occur in the
  curve of states, and that in the neighbourhood of this break the curve
  above that point must ascend less rapidly than the curve below the break.
  Since, however, the differences in the vapour pressures of supercooled
  water and of ice are very small, the change in the direction of the
  vapour-pressure curve on passing from ice to water was at first not
  observed, and Regnault regarded the sublimation curve as passing
  continuously into <!-- Page 32 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page32"></a>{32}</span>the vaporization curve. The existence of a
  break was, however, shown by James Thomson<a name="NtA41"
  href="#Nt41"><sup>[41]</sup></a> and by Kirchhoff<a name="NtA42"
  href="#Nt42"><sup>[42]</sup></a> to be demanded by thermo-dynamical
  considerations, and the prediction of theory was afterwards realized
  experimentally by Ramsay and Young in their determinations of the vapour
  pressure of water and ice, as well as in the case of other substances.<a
  name="NtA43" href="#Nt43"><sup>[43]</sup></a></p>

  <p>From what has just been said, we can readily understand why ice and
  water cannot exist in equilibrium below 0°. For, suppose we have ice and
  water in the same closed space, but not in contact with one another, then
  since the vapour pressure of the supercooled water is higher than that of
  ice, the vapour of the former must be supersaturated in contact with the
  latter; vapour must, therefore, condense on the ice; and in this way
  there will be a slow distillation from the water to the ice, until at
  last all the water will have disappeared, and only ice and vapour
  remain.<a name="NtA44" href="#Nt44"><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Other Systems of the Substance Water.</b>&mdash;We have thus far
  discussed only those systems which are constituted by the three
  phases&mdash;ice, water, and water vapour. It has, however, been recently
  found that at a low temperature and under a high pressure ordinary ice
  can pass into two other crystalline varieties, called by Tammann<a
  name="NtA45" href="#Nt45"><sup>[45]</sup></a> ice II. and ice III.,
  ordinary ice being ice I. According to the Phase Rule, now, since each of
  these solid forms constitutes a separate phase (p.&nbsp;<a
  href="#page9">9</a>), it will be possible to have the following (and
  more) systems of water, in addition to those already studied, viz. water,
  ice I., ice II.; water, ice I., ice III.; water, ice II., ice III.,
  forming invariant systems and existing in equilibrium only at a definite
  triple point; further, water, ice II.; water, ice III.; ice I., ice II.;
  ice I., ice III.; ice II., ice III., forming univariant systems,
  existing, therefore, at definite corresponding values of <!-- Page 33
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page33"></a>{33}</span>temperature and
  pressure; and lastly, the bivariant systems, ice II. and ice III. Several
  of these systems have been investigated by Tammann. The triple point for
  water, ice I., ice III., lies at -22°, and a pressure of 2200 kilogms.
  per sq. cm. (2130 atm.), as indicated in Fig. 2, <span class="correction"
  title="Original reads 'p. 25.'.">p.&nbsp;<a href="#page27">27</a>.</span><a
  name="NtA46" href="#Nt46"><sup>[46]</sup></a> In contrast with the
  behaviour of ordinary ice, the temperature of equilibrium in the case of
  water&mdash;ice II., and water&mdash;ice III., is <i>raised</i> by
  increase of pressure.</p>

<p class="cenhead">B. <i>Sulphur.</i></p>

  <p><b>Polymorphism.</b>&mdash;Reference has just been made to the fact
  that ice can exist not only in the ordinary form, but in at least two
  other crystalline varieties. This phenomenon, the existence of a
  substance in two or more different crystalline forms, is called
  <i>polymorphism</i>. Polymorphism was first observed by Mitscherlich<a
  name="NtA47" href="#Nt47"><sup>[47]</sup></a> in the case of sodium
  phosphate, and later in the case of sulphur. To these two cases others
  were soon added, at first of inorganic, and later of organic substances,
  so that polymorphism is now recognized as of very frequent occurrence
  indeed.<a name="NtA48" href="#Nt48"><sup>[48]</sup></a> These various
  forms of a substance differ not only in crystalline shape, but also in
  melting point, specific gravity, and other physical properties. In the
  liquid state, however, the differences do not exist.</p>

  <p>According to our definition of phases (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page9">9</a>),
  each of these polymorphic forms constitutes a separate phase of the
  particular substance. As is readily apparent, the number of possible
  systems formed of one component may be considerably increased when that
  component is capable of existing in different crystalline forms. We have,
  therefore, to inquire what are the conditions under which different
  polymorphic forms can coexist, either alone or in presence of the liquid
  and vapour phase. For the purpose of illustrating the general behaviour
  of such systems, we shall study the systems formed by the different
  crystalline forms of sulphur, tin, and benzophenone.</p>

<p><!-- Page 34 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page34"></a>{34}</span></p>

  <p><b>Sulphur</b> exists in two well-known crystalline
  forms&mdash;rhombic, or octahedral, and monoclinic, or prismatic sulphur.
  Of these, the former melts at 114.5°; the latter at 120°.<a name="NtA49"
  href="#Nt49"><sup>[49]</sup></a> Further, at the ordinary temperature,
  rhombic sulphur can exist unchanged, whereas, on being heated to
  temperatures somewhat below the melting point, it passes into the
  prismatic variety. On the other hand, at temperatures above 96°,
  prismatic sulphur can remain unchanged, whereas at the ordinary
  temperature it passes slowly into the rhombic form.</p>

  <p>If, now, we examine the case of sulphur with the help of the Phase
  Rule, we see that the following systems are theoretically
  possible:&mdash;</p>

  <p><b>Triple Point&mdash;Rhombic and Monoclinic Sulphur and Vapour.
  Transition Point.</b>&mdash;In the case of ice, water and vapour, we saw
  that at the triple point the vapour pressures of ice and water are equal;
  below this point, ice is stable; above this point, water is stable. We
  saw, further, that below 0° the vapour pressure of the stable system is
  lower than that of the metastable, and therefore that at the triple point
  there is a break in the vapour pressure curve of such a kind that above
  <!-- Page 35 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page35"></a>{35}</span>the
  triple point the vapour-pressure curve ascends more slowly than below it.
  Now, although the vapour pressure of solid sulphur has not been
  determined, we can nevertheless consider that it does possess a certain,
  even if very small, vapour pressure,<a name="NtA50"
  href="#Nt50"><sup>[50]</sup></a> and that at the temperature at which the
  vapour pressures of rhombic and monoclinic sulphur become equal, we can
  have these two solid forms existing in equilibrium with the vapour. Below
  that point only one form, that with the lower vapour pressure, will be
  stable; above that point only the other form will be stable. On passing
  through the triple point, therefore, there will be a change of the one
  form into the other. This point is represented in our diagram (Fig. 5) by
  the point O, the two curves AO and OB representing diagrammatically the
  vapour pressures of rhombic and monoclinic sulphur respectively. If the
  vapour phase is absent and the system maintained under a constant
  pressure, <i>e.g.</i> <!-- Page 36 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page36"></a>{36}</span>atmospheric pressure, there will also be a
  definite temperature at which the two solid forms are in equilibrium, and
  on passing through which complete and reversible transformation of one
  form into the other occurs. This temperature, which refers to equilibrium
  in absence of the vapour phase, is known as the <i>transition
  temperature</i> or <i>inversion temperature</i>.</p>

  <p>Were we dependent on measurements of pressure and temperature, the
  determination of the transition point might be a matter of great
  difficulty. When we consider, however, that the other physical properties
  of the solid phases, <i>e.g.</i> the density, undergo an abrupt change on
  passing through the transition point, owing to the transformation of one
  form into the other, then any method by which this abrupt change in the
  physical properties can be detected may be employed for determining the
  transition point. A considerable number of such methods have been
  devised, and a description of the most important of these is given in the
  Appendix.</p>

  <p>In the case of sulphur, the transition point of rhombic into
  monoclinic sulphur was found by Reicher<a name="NtA51"
  href="#Nt51"><sup>[51]</sup></a> to lie at 95.5°. Below this temperature
  the octahedral, above it the monoclinic, is the stable form.</p>

  <p><b>Condensed Systems.</b>&mdash;We have already seen that in the
  change of the melting point of water with the pressure, a very great
  increase of the latter was necessary in order to produce a comparatively
  small change in the temperature of equilibrium. This is a characteristic
  of all systems from which the vapour phase is absent, and which are
  composed only of solid and liquid phases. Such systems are called
  <i>condensed systems</i>,<a name="NtA52" href="#Nt52"><sup>[52]</sup></a>
  and in determining the temperature of equilibrium of such systems,
  practically the same point will be obtained whether the measurements are
  carried out under atmospheric pressure or under the pressure of the
  vapour of the solid or liquid phases. The transition point, therefore, as
  determined in open vessels at atmospheric pressure, will differ only by a
  very slight amount from the triple point, or point at which the two solid
  or liquid phases are in equilibrium under the pressure of their vapour.
  <!-- Page 37 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page37"></a>{37}</span>The
  determination of the transition point is thereby greatly simplified.</p>

  <p><b>Suspended Transformation.</b>&mdash;In many respects the transition
  point of two solid phases is analogous to the melting point of a solid,
  or point at which the solid passes into a liquid. In both cases the
  change of phase is associated with a definite temperature and pressure in
  such a way that below the point the one phase, above the point the other
  phase, is stable. The transition point, however, differs in so far from a
  point of fusion, that while it is possible to supercool a liquid, no
  definite case is known where the solid has been heated above the triple
  point without passing into the liquid state. Transformation, therefore,
  is suspended only on one side of the melting point. In the case of two
  solid phases, however, the transition point can be overstepped in both
  directions, so that each phase can be obtained in the metastable
  condition. In the case of supercooled water, further, we saw that the
  introduction of the stable, solid phase caused the speedy transformation
  of the metastable to the stable condition of equilibrium; but in the case
  of two solid phases the change from the metastable to the stable
  modification may occur with great slowness, even in presence of the
  stable form. This tardiness with which the stable condition of
  equilibrium is reached greatly increases in many cases the difficulty of
  accurately determining the transition point. The phenomena of suspended
  transformation will, however, receive a fuller discussion later (p.&nbsp;<a
  href="#page68">68</a>).</p>

  <p><b>Transition Curve&mdash;Rhombic and Monoclinic
  Sulphur.</b>&mdash;Just as we found the melting point of ice to vary with
  the pressure, so also do we find that change of pressure causes an
  alteration in the transition point. In the case of the transition point
  of rhombic into monoclinic sulphur, increase of pressure by 1 atm. raises
  the transition point by 0.04°-0.05°.<a name="NtA53"
  href="#Nt53"><sup>[53]</sup></a> The transition curve, or curve
  representing the change of the transition point with pressure, will
  therefore slope to the right away from the pressure axis. This is curve
  OC (Fig. 5).</p>

<p><!-- Page 38 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page38"></a>{38}</span></p>

  <p><b>Triple Point&mdash;Monoclinic Sulphur, Liquid, and Vapour. Melting
  Point of Monoclinic Sulphur.</b>&mdash;Above 95.5°, monoclinic sulphur
  is, as we have seen, the stable form. On being heated to 120°, under
  atmospheric pressure, it melts. This temperature is, therefore, the point
  of equilibrium between monoclinic sulphur and liquid sulphur under
  atmospheric pressure. Since we are dealing with a condensed system, this
  temperature may be regarded as very nearly that at which the solid and
  liquid are in equilibrium with their vapour, <i>i.e.</i> the triple
  point, solid (monoclinic)&mdash;liquid&mdash;vapour. This point is
  represented in the diagram by B.</p>

  <p><b>Triple Point&mdash;Rhombic and Monoclinic Sulphur and
  Liquid.</b>&mdash;In contrast with that of ice, the fusion point of
  monoclinic sulphur is <i>raised</i> by increase of pressure, and the
  fusion curve, therefore, slopes to the right. The transition curve of
  rhombic and monoclinic sulphur, as we have seen, also slopes to the
  right, and more so than the fusion curve of monoclinic sulphur. There
  will, therefore, be a certain pressure and temperature at which the two
  curves will cut. This point lies at 151°, and a pressure of 1320 kilogm.
  per sq. cm., or about 1288 atm.<a name="NtA54"
  href="#Nt54"><sup>[54]</sup></a> It, therefore, forms another triple
  point, the existence of which had been predicted by Roozeboom,<a
  name="NtA55" href="#Nt55"><sup>[55]</sup></a> at which rhombic and
  monoclinic sulphur are in equilibrium with liquid sulphur. It is
  represented in our diagram by the point C. <i>Beyond this point
  monoclinic sulphur ceases to exist in a stable condition.</i> At
  temperatures and pressures above this triple point, rhombic sulphur will
  be the stable modification, and this fact is of mineralogical interest,
  because it explains the occurrence in nature of well-formed rhombic
  crystals. Under ordinary conditions, prismatic sulphur separates out on
  cooling fused sulphur, but at temperatures above 151° and under pressures
  greater than 1288 atm., the rhombic form would be produced.<a
  name="NtA56" href="#Nt56"><sup>[56]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Triple Point&mdash;Rhombic Sulphur, Liquid, and Vapour. Metastable
  Triple Point.</b>&mdash;On account of the slowness with <!-- Page 39
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page39"></a>{39}</span>which
  transformation of one form into the other takes place on passing the
  transition point, it has been found possible to heat rhombic sulphur up
  to its melting point (114.5°). At this temperature, not only is rhombic
  sulphur in a metastable condition, but the liquid is also metastable, its
  vapour pressure being greater than that of solid monoclinic sulphur. This
  point is represented in our diagram by the point <i>b</i>.</p>

  <p>From the relative positions of the metastable melting point of rhombic
  sulphur and the stable melting point of monoclinic sulphur at 120°, we
  see that, of the two forms, the metastable form has the lower melting
  point. This, of course, is valid only for the relative stability in the
  neighbourhood of the melting point; for we have already learned that at
  lower temperatures rhombic sulphur is the stable, monoclinic sulphur the
  metastable (or unstable) form.</p>

  <p><b>Fusion Curve of Rhombic Sulphur.</b>&mdash;Like any other melting
  point, that of rhombic sulphur will be displaced by increase of pressure;
  increase of pressure raises the melting point, and we can therefore
  obtain a metastable fusion curve representing the conditions under which
  rhombic sulphur is in equilibrium with liquid sulphur. This metastable
  fusion curve must pass through the triple point for rhombic
  sulphur&mdash;monoclinic sulphur&mdash;liquid sulphur, and on passing
  this point it becomes a stable fusion curve. The continuation of this
  curve, therefore, above 151° forms the stable fusion curve of rhombic
  sulphur (curve CD).</p>

  <p>These curves have been investigated at high pressures by Tammann, and
  the results are represented according to scale in Fig. 6,<a name="NtA57"
  href="#Nt57"><sup>[57]</sup></a> <i>a</i> being the curve for monoclinic
  sulphur and liquid; <i>b</i>, that for rhombic sulphur and liquid; and
  <i>c</i>, that for rhombic and monoclinic sulphur.</p>

  <p><b>Bivariant Systems.</b>&mdash;Just as in the case of the diagram of
  states of water, the areas in Fig. 5 represent the conditions for the
  stable existence of the single phases: rhombic sulphur in the area to the

<p class="cenhead">C. <i>Tin.</i></p>

  <p>Another substance capable of existing in more than one crystalline
  form, is the metal tin, and although the general behaviour, so far as
  studied, is analogous to that of sulphur, a short account of the two
  varieties of tin may be given here, not only on account of their
  metallurgical interest, but also on account of the importance which the
  phenomena possess for the employment of this metal in everyday life.</p>

  <p>After a winter of extreme severity in Russia (1867-1868), the somewhat
  unpleasant discovery was made that a number of blocks of tin, which had
  been stored in the Customs House at St. Petersburg, had undergone
  disintegration and crumbled to a grey powder.<a name="NtA59"
  href="#Nt59"><sup>[59]</sup></a> That tin undergoes change on exposure to
  extreme cold was known, however, before that time, even as far back as
  the time of Aristotle, who spoke of the tin as "melting."<a name="NtA60"
  href="#Nt60"><sup>[60]</sup></a> Ludicrous as that term may now appear,
  Aristotle nevertheless unconsciously employed a strikingly accurate
  analogy, for the conditions under which ordinary white tin passes into
  the grey modification are, in many ways, quite analogous to those under
  which a substance passes from the solid to the liquid state. The
  knowledge of this was, however, beyond the wisdom of the Greek
  philosopher.</p>

  <p>For many years there existed considerable confusion both as to the
  conditions under which the transformation of white tin into its
  allotropic modification occurs, and to the reason of the change. Under
  the guidance of the Phase Rule, however, the confusion which obtained has
  been cleared away, and the "mysterious" behaviour of tin brought into
  accord with other phenomena of transformation.<a name="NtA61"
  href="#Nt61"><sup>[61]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Transition Point.</b>&mdash;Just as in the case of sulphur, so also
  in the case of tin, there is a transition point above which the <!-- Page
  42 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page42"></a>{42}</span>one form,
  ordinary white tin, and below which the other form, grey tin, is the
  stable variety. In the case of this metal, the transition point was found
  by Cohen and van Eyk, who employed both the dilatometric and the
  electrical methods (Appendix) to be 20°. Below this temperature, grey tin
  is the stable form. But, as we have seen in the case of sulphur, the
  change of the metastable into the stable solid phase occurs with
  considerable slowness, and this behaviour is found also in the case of
  tin. Were it not so, we should not be able to use this metal for the many
  purposes to which it is applied in everyday life; for, with the exception
  of a comparatively small number of days in the year, the temperature of
  our climate is below 20°, and <i>white tin is, therefore, at the ordinary
  temperature, in a metastable condition</i>. The change, however, into the
  stable form at the ordinary temperature, although slow, nevertheless
  takes place, as is shown by the partial or entire conversion of articles
  of tin which have lain buried for several hundreds of years.</p>

  <p>On lowering the temperature, the velocity with which the
  transformation of the tin occurs is increased, and Cohen and van Eyk
  found that the temperature of maximum velocity is about -50°. Contact
  with the stable form will, of course, facilitate the transformation.</p>

  <p>The change of white tin into grey takes place also with increased
  velocity in presence of a solution of tin ammonium chloride (pink salt),
  which is able to dissolve small quantities of tin. In presence of such a
  solution also, it was found that the temperature at which the velocity of
  transformation was greatest was raised to 0°. At this temperature, white
  tin in contact with a solution of tin ammonium chloride, and the grey
  modification, undergoes transformation to an appreciable extent in the
  course of a few days.</p>

  <p>Fig. 7 is a photograph of a piece of white tin undergoing
  transformation into the grey variety.<a name="NtA62"
  href="#Nt62"><sup>[62]</sup></a> The bright surface of the tin becomes
  covered with a number of warty masses, formed of the less dense grey
  form, and the number and size of these continue to grow until the whole
  of the white tin has passed <!-- Page 43 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page43"></a>{43}</span>into a grey powder. On account of the
  appearance which is here seen, this transformation of tin has been called
  by Cohen the "tin plague."</p>

  <p><b>Enantiotropy and Monotropy.</b>&mdash;In the case of sulphur and
  tin, we have met with two substances existing in polymorphic forms, and
  we have also learned that these forms exhibit a definite transition point
  at which their relative stability is reversed. Each form, therefore,
  possesses a definite range of stable existence, and is capable of
  undergoing transformation into the other, at temperatures above or below
  that of the transition point.</p>

  <p>Another class of dimorphous substances is, however, met with as, for
  instance, in the case of the well-known compounds iodine monochloride and
  benzophenone. Each crystalline form has its own melting point, the
  dimorphous forms of iodine monochloride melting at 13.9° and 27.2°,<a
  name="NtA63" href="#Nt63"><sup>[63]</sup></a> and those of benzophenone
  at 26° and 48°.<a name="NtA64" href="#Nt64"><sup>[64]</sup></a> This
  class of substance differs from that which we have already studied
  (<i>e.g.</i> sulphur and tin), in that at all temperatures up to the
  melting point, only one of the forms is stable, the other being
  metastable. There is, therefore, no transition point, and transformation
  of the crystalline forms can be observed <i>only in one direction</i>.
  These two classes of phenomena are distinguished by the names
  <i>enantiotropy</i> and <i>monotropy</i>; enantiotropic substances being
  such that the change of one form into the other is a reversible process
  (<i>e.g.</i> rhombic sulphur into monoclinic, and monoclinic sulphur into
  rhombic), and monotropic substances, those in which the transformation of
  the crystalline forms is irreversible.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:21%;">
      <a href="images/fig009.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig009.png"
      alt="Fig. 9" title="Fig. 9" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 9.</span>

  <div class="figright" style="width:19%;">
      <a href="images/fig008.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig008.png"
      alt="Fig. 8" title="Fig. 8" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 8.</span>
  </div>

  <p>These differences in the behaviour can be explained very well in many
  cases by supposing that in the case of enantiotropic substances the
  transition point lies below the melting point, while in the case of
  monotropic substances, it lies above the melting point.<a name="NtA65"
  href="#Nt65"><sup>[65]</sup></a> These conditions would be represented by
  the Figs. 8 and 9.</p>

  <p>In these two figures, O<sub>3</sub> is the transition point,
  O<sub>1</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> the melting points of the metastable and
  stable forms <!-- Page 45 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page45"></a>{45}</span>respectively. From Fig. 9 we see that the
  crystalline form I. at all temperatures up to its melting point is
  metastable with respect to the form II. In such cases the transition
  point could be reached only at higher pressures.</p>

  <p>Although, as already stated, this explanation suffices for many cases,
  it does not prove that in all cases of monotropy the transition point is
  above the melting point of the two forms. It is also quite possible that
  the transition point may lie below the melting points;<a name="NtA66"
  href="#Nt66"><sup>[66]</sup></a> in this case we have what is known as
  <i>pseudomonotropy</i>. It is possible that graphite and diamond,<a
  name="NtA67" href="#Nt67"><sup>[67]</sup></a> perhaps also the two forms
  of phosphorus, stand in the relation of pseudomonotropy (<i>v.</i> p.&nbsp;<a
  href="#page49">49</a>).</p>

  <p>The disposition of the curves in Figs. 8 and 9 also explains the
  phenomenon sometimes met with, especially in organic chemistry, that the
  substance first melts, then solidifies, and remelts at a higher
  temperature. On again determining the melting point after
  re-solidification, only the higher melting point is obtained.</p>

  <p>The explanation of such a behaviour is, that if the determination of
  the melting point is carried out rapidly, the point O<sub>1</sub>, the
  melting point of the metastable solid form, may be realized. At this
  temperature, however, the liquid is metastable with respect to the stable
  solid form, and if the temperature is <!-- Page 46 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page46"></a>{46}</span>not allowed to rise above
  the melting point of the latter, the liquid may solidify. The stable
  solid modification thus obtained will melt only at a higher
  temperature.</p>

<p class="cenhead">D. <i>Phosphorus.</i></p>

  <p>An interesting case of a monotropic dimorphous substance is found in
  phosphorus, which occurs in two crystalline forms; white phosphorus
  belonging to the regular system, and red phosphorus belonging to the
  hexagonal system. From determinations of the vapour pressures of liquid
  white phosphorus, and of solid red phosphorus,<a name="NtA68"
  href="#Nt68"><sup>[68]</sup></a> it was found that the vapour pressure of
  red phosphorus was considerably lower than that of liquid white
  phosphorus at the same temperature, the values obtained being given in
  the following table.</p>

  <p>These values are also represented graphically in Fig. 10.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:21%;">

    <span class="sc">Fig. 10.</span>
  </div>

  <p>At all temperatures above about 260°, transformation of the white into
  the red modification takes place with appreciable velocity, and this
  velocity increases as the temperature is raised. Even at lower
  temperatures, <i>e.g.</i> at the ordinary temperature, the velocity of
  transformation is increased under the influence <!-- Page 47 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page47"></a>{47}</span>of light,<a name="NtA69"
  href="#Nt69"><sup>[69]</sup></a> or by the presence of certain
  substances, <i>e.g.</i> iodine,<a name="NtA70"
  href="#Nt70"><sup>[70]</sup></a> just as the velocity of transformation
  of white tin into the grey modification was increased by the presence of
  a solution of tin ammonium chloride (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page40">40</a>). At the
  ordinary temperature, therefore, white phosphorus must be considered as
  the less stable (metastable) form, for although it can exist in contact
  with red phosphorus for a long period, its vapour pressure, as we have
  seen, is greater than that of the red modification, and also, its
  solubility in different solvents is greater<a name="NtA71"
  href="#Nt71"><sup>[71]</sup></a> than that of the red modification; as we
  shall find later, the solubility of the metastable form is always greater
  than that of the stable.</p>

  <p>The relationships which are met with in the case of phosphorus can be
  best represented by the diagram, Fig. 11.<a name="NtA72"
  href="#Nt72"><sup>[72]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In this figure, BO<sub>1</sub> represents the conditions of
  equilibrium of the univariant system red phosphorus and vapour, which
  ends at O<sub>1</sub>, the melting point of red phosphorus. By heating in
  capillary tubes of hard glass, Chapman<a name="NtA73"
  href="#Nt73"><sup>[73]</sup></a> found that red phosphorus melts at the
  melting point of potassium iodide, <i>i.e.</i> about 630°,<a name="NtA74"
  href="#Nt74"><sup>[74]</sup></a> but the pressure at this temperature is
  unknown.</p>

  <p>At O<sub>1</sub>, then, we have the triple point, red phosphorus,
  liquid, and vapour, and starting from it, we should have the <!-- Page 48
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page48"></a>{48}</span>vaporization
  curve of liquid phosphorus, O<sub>1</sub>A, and the fusion curve of red
  phosphorus, O<sub>1</sub>F. Although these have not been determined, the
  latter curve must, from theoretical considerations (<i>v.</i> p.&nbsp;<a
  href="#page58">58</a>), slope slightly to the right; <i>i.e.</i> increase
  of pressure raises the melting point of red phosphorus.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:30%;">
      <a href="images/fig011.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig011.png"
      alt="Fig. 11" title="Fig. 11" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 11.</span>
  </div>

  <p>When white phosphorus is heated to 44°, it melts. At this point,
  therefore, we shall have another triple point, white
  phosphorus&mdash;liquid&mdash;vapour; the pressure at this point has been
  calculated to be 3 mm.<a name="NtA75" href="#Nt75"><sup>[75]</sup></a>
  This point is the intersection of three curves, viz. sublimation curve,
  vaporization curve, and the fusion curve of white phosphorus. The fusion
  curve, O<sub>2</sub>E, has been determined by Tammann<a name="NtA76"
  href="#Nt76"><sup>[76]</sup></a> and by G. A. Hulett,<a name="NtA77"
  href="#Nt77"><sup>[77]</sup></a> and it was found that increase of
  pressure by 1 atm. raises the melting point by 0.029°. The sublimation
  curve of white phosphorus has not yet been determined.</p>

  <p>As can be seen from the table of vapour pressures (p.&nbsp;<a
  href="#page46">46</a>), the vapour pressure of white phosphorus has been
  determined up to 500°; at temperatures above this, however, the velocity
  with which transformation into red phosphorus takes place is so great as
  to render the determination of the vapour pressure <!-- Page 49 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page49"></a>{49}</span>at higher temperatures
  impossible. Since, however, the difference between white phosphorus and
  red phosphorus disappears in the liquid state, the vapour pressure curve
  of white phosphorus must pass through the point O<sub>1</sub>, the
  melting point of red phosphorus, and must be continuous with the curve
  O<sub>1</sub>A, the vapour pressure curve of liquid phosphorus (<i>vide
  infra</i>). Since, as Fig. 10 shows, the vapour pressure curve of white
  phosphorus ascends very rapidly at higher temperatures, the "break"
  between BO<sub>1</sub> and O<sub>1</sub>A must be very slight.</p>

  <p>As compared with monotropic substances like benzophenone, phosphorus
  exhibits the peculiarity that transformation of the metastable into the
  stable modification takes place with great slowness; and further, the
  time required for the production of equilibrium between red phosphorus
  and phosphorus vapour is great compared with that required for
  establishing the same equilibrium in the case of white phosphorus. This
  behaviour can be best explained by the assumption that change in the
  molecular complexity (polymerization) occurs in the conversion of white
  into red phosphorus, and when red phosphorus passes into vapour
  (depolymerization).<a name="NtA78" href="#Nt78"><sup>[78]</sup></a></p>

  <p>This is borne out by the fact that measurements of the vapour density
  of phosphorus vapour at temperatures of 500° and more, show it to have
  the molecular weight represented by P<sub>4</sub>,<a name="NtA79"
  href="#Nt79"><sup>[79]</sup></a> and the same molecular weight has been
  found for phosphorus in solution.<a name="NtA80"
  href="#Nt80"><sup>[80]</sup></a> On the other hand, it has recently been
  shown by R. Schenck,<a name="NtA81" href="#Nt81"><sup>[81]</sup></a> that
  the molecular weight of red phosphorus is at least P<sub>8</sub>, and
  very possibly higher.</p>

  <p>In the case of phosphorus, therefore, it is more than possible that we
  are dealing, not simply with two polymorphic <!-- Page 50 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page50"></a>{50}</span>forms of the same
  substance, but with polymeric forms, and that there is no transition
  point at temperatures above the absolute zero, unless we assume the
  molecular complexity of the two forms to become the same. The curve for
  red phosphorus would therefore lie below that of white phosphorus, for
  the vapour pressure of the polymeric form, if produced from the simpler
  form with evolution of heat, must be lower than that of the latter. A
  transition point would, of course, become possible if the sign of the
  heat effect in the transformation of the one modification into the other
  should change. If, further, the liquid which is produced by the fusion of
  red phosphorus at 630° under high pressure also exists in a polymeric
  form, greater than P<sub>4</sub>, then the metastable vaporization curve
  of white phosphorus would not pass through the melting point of red
  phosphorus, as was assumed above.<a name="NtA82"
  href="#Nt82"><sup>[82]</sup></a></p>

  <p>We have already seen in the case of water (p.&nbsp;<a
  href="#page31">31</a>) that the vapour pressure of supercooled water is
  greater than that of ice, and that therefore it is possible,
  theoretically at least, by a process of distillation, to transfer the
  water from one end of a closed tube to the other, and to there condense
  it as ice. On account of the very small difference between the vapour
  pressure of supercooled water and ice, this distillation process has not
  been experimentally realized. In the case of phosphorus, however, where
  the difference in the vapour pressures is comparatively great, it has
  been found possible to distil white phosphorus from one part of a closed
  tube to another, and to there condense it as red phosphorus; and since
  the vapour pressure of red phosphorus at 350° is less than the vapour
  pressure of white phosphorus at 200°, it is possible to carry out the
  distillation from a <i>colder</i> part of the tube to a <i>hotter</i>, by
  having white phosphorus at the former and red phosphorus at the latter.
  Such a process of distillation has been carried out by Troost and
  Hautefeuille between 324° and 350°.<a name="NtA83"
  href="#Nt83"><sup>[83]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Relationships similar to those found in the case of phosphorus are
  also met with in the case of cyanogen and <!-- Page 51 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page51"></a>{51}</span>paracyanogen, which have
  been studied by Chappuis,<a name="NtA84" href="#Nt84"><sup>[84]</sup></a>
  Troost and Hautefeuille,<a name="NtA85" href="#Nt85"><sup>[85]</sup></a>
  and Dewar,<a name="NtA86" href="#Nt86"><sup>[86]</sup></a> and also in
  the case of other organic substances.</p>

  <p><b>Enantiotropy combined with Monotropy.</b>&mdash;Not only can
  polymorphic substances exhibit enantiotropy or monotropy, but, if the
  substance is capable of existing in more than two crystalline forms, both
  relationships may be found, so that some of the forms may be
  enantiotropic to one another, while the other forms exhibit only
  monotropy. This behaviour is seen in the case of sulphur, which can exist
  in as many as eight different crystalline varieties. Of these only
  monoclinic and rhombic sulphur exhibit the relationship of enantiotropy,
  <i>i.e.</i> they possess a definite transition point, while the other
  forms are all metastable with respect to rhombic and monoclinic sulphur,
  and remain so up to the melting point; that is to say, they are
  monotropic modifications.<a name="NtA87"
  href="#Nt87"><sup>[87]</sup></a></p>

<p class="cenhead">E. <i>Liquid Crystals.</i></p>

  <p><b>Phenomena observed.</b>&mdash;In 1888 it was discovered by
  Reinitzer<a name="NtA88" href="#Nt88"><sup>[88]</sup></a> that the two
  substances, cholesteryl acetate and cholesteryl benzoate, possess the
  peculiar property of melting sharply at a definite temperature to milky
  liquids; and that the latter, on being further heated, suddenly become
  clear, also at a definite temperature. Other substances, more especially
  <i>p</i>-azoxyanisole and <i>p</i>-azoxyphenetole, were, later, found to
  possess the same property of having apparently a double melting point.<a
  name="NtA89" href="#Nt89"><sup>[89]</sup></a> On cooling the clear
  liquids, the reverse series of changes occurred.</p>

  <p>The turbid liquids which were thus obtained were found to possess not
  only the usual properties of liquids (such as the <!-- Page 52 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page52"></a>{52}</span>property of flowing and
  of assuming a perfectly spherical shape when suspended in a liquid of the
  same density), but also those properties which had hitherto been observed
  only in the case of solid crystalline substances, viz. the property of
  double refraction and of giving interference colours when examined by
  polarized light; the turbid liquids are <i>anisotropic</i>. To such
  liquids, the optical properties of which were discovered by O. Lehmann,<a
  name="NtA90" href="#Nt90"><sup>[90]</sup></a> the name <i>liquid
  crystals</i>, or crystalline liquids, was given.</p>

  <p><b>Nature of Liquid Crystals.</b>&mdash;During the past ten years the
  question as to the nature of liquid crystals has been discussed by a
  number of investigators, several of whom have contended strongly against
  the idea of the term "liquid" being applied to the crystalline condition;
  and various attempts have been made to prove that the turbid liquids are
  in reality heterogeneous and are to be classed along with emulsions.<a
  name="NtA91" href="#Nt91"><sup>[91]</sup></a> This view was no doubt
  largely suggested by the fact that the anisotropic liquids were turbid,
  whereas the "solid" crystals were clear. Lehmann found, however, that,
  when examined under the microscope, the "simple" liquid crystals were
  also clear,<a name="NtA92" href="#Nt92"><sup>[92]</sup></a> the apparent
  turbidity being due to the aggregation of a number of differently
  oriented crystals, in the same way as a piece of marble does not appear
  transparent although composed of transparent crystals.<a name="NtA93"
  href="#Nt93"><sup>[93]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Further, no proof of the heterogeneity of liquid crystals has yet been
  obtained, but rather all chemical and physical investigations indicate
  that they are homogeneous.<a name="NtA94"
  href="#Nt94"><sup>[94]</sup></a> No separation <!-- Page 53 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page53"></a>{53}</span>of a solid substance from
  the milky, anisotropic liquids has been effected; the anisotropic liquid
  is in some cases less viscous than the isotropic liquid formed at a
  higher temperature; and the temperature of liquefaction is constant, and
  is affected by pressure and admixture with foreign substances exactly as
  in the case of a pure substance.<a name="NtA95"
  href="#Nt95"><sup>[95]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Equilibrium Relations in the Case of Liquid
  Crystals.</b>&mdash;Since, now, we have seen that we are dealing here
  with substances in two crystalline forms (which we may call the solid and
  liquid<a name="NtA96" href="#Nt96"><sup>[96]</sup></a> crystalline form),
  which possess a definite transition point, at which, transformation of
  the one form into the other occurs in both directions, we can represent
  the conditions of equilibrium by a diagram in all respects similar to
  that employed in the case of other enantiotropic substances, <i>e.g.</i>
  sulphur (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page35">35</a>).</p>

<p><!-- Page 54 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page54"></a>{54}</span></p>

  <p>In Fig. 12 there is given a diagrammatic representation of the
  relationships found in the case of <i>p</i>-azoxyanisole.<a name="NtA97"
  href="#Nt97"><sup>[97]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Although the vapour pressure of the substance in the solid, or liquid
  state, has not been determined, it will be understood from what we have
  already learned, that the curves AO, OB, BC, representing the vapour
  pressure of solid crystals, liquid crystals, isotropic liquid, must have
  the relative positions shown in the diagram. Point O, the transition
  point of the solid into the liquid crystals, lies at 118.27°, and the
  change of the transition point with the pressure is +0.032° pro 1 atm.
  The transition curve OE slopes, therefore, slightly to the right. The
  point B, the melting point of the liquid crystals, lies at 135.85°, and
  the melting point is raised 0.0485° pro 1 atm. The curve BD, therefore,
  also slopes to the right, and more so than the transition curve. In this
  respect azoxyanisole is different from sulphur.</p>

  <p>The areas bounded by the curves represent the conditions for the
  stable existence of the four single phases, solid crystals, liquid
  crystals, isotropic liquid and vapour.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<p class="cenhead">GENERAL SUMMARY</p>

  <p>In the preceding pages we have learned how the principles of the Phase
  Rule can be applied to the elucidation of various systems consisting of
  one component. In the present chapter it is proposed to give a short
  summary of the relationships we have met with, and also to discuss more
  generally how the Phase Rule applies to other one-component systems. On
  account of the fact that beginners are sometimes inclined to expect too
  much of the Phase Rule; to expect, for example, that it will inform them
  as to the exact behaviour of a substance, it may here be emphasized that
  the Phase Rule is a general rule; it informs us only as to the general
  conditions of equilibrium, and leaves the determination of the definite,
  numerical data to experiment.</p>

  <p><b>Triple Point.</b>&mdash;We have already (p.&nbsp;<a
  href="#page28">28</a>) defined a triple point in a one-component system,
  as being that pressure and temperature at which three phases coexist in
  equilibrium; it represents, therefore, an invariant system (p.&nbsp;<a
  href="#page16">16</a>). At the triple point also, three curves cut, viz.
  the curves representing the conditions of equilibrium of the three
  univariant systems formed by the combination of the three phases in
  pairs. The most common triple point of a one-component system is, of
  course, the triple point, solid, liquid, vapour (S-L-V), but other triple
  points<a name="NtA99" href="#Nt99"><sup>[99]</sup></a> are also possible
  when, as in the case of <!-- Page 56 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page56"></a>{56}</span>sulphur or benzophenone, polymorphic forms
  occur. Whether or not all the triple points can be experimentally
  realized will, of course, depend on circumstances. We shall, in the first
  place, consider only the triple point S-L-V.</p>

  <p>As to the general arrangement of the three univariant curves around
  the triple point, the following rules may be given. (1) The prolongation
  of each of the curves beyond the triple point must lie between the other
  two curves. (2) The middle position at one and the same temperature in
  the neighbourhood of the triple point is taken by that curve (or its
  metastable prolongation) which represents the two phases of most widely
  differing specific volume.<a name="NtA100"
  href="#Nt100"><sup>[100]</sup></a> That is to say, if a line of constant
  temperature is drawn immediately above or below the triple point so as to
  cut the three curves&mdash;two stable curves and the metastable
  prolongation of the third&mdash;the position of the curves at that
  temperature will be such that the middle position is occupied by that
  curve (or its metastable prolongation) which represents the two phases of
  most widely differing specific volume.</p>

  <p>Now, although these rules admit of a considerable variety of possible
  arrangements of curves around the triple point,<a name="NtA101"
  href="#Nt101"><sup>[101]</sup></a> only two of these have been
  experimentally obtained in the case of the triple point
  solid&mdash;liquid&mdash;vapour. At present, therefore, we shall consider
  only these two cases (Figs. 13 and 14).</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:19%;">
      <a href="images/fig014.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig014.png"
      alt="Fig. 14" title="Fig. 14" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 14.</span>
  </div>

  <div class="figright" style="width:20%;">
      <a href="images/fig013.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig013.png"
      alt="Fig. 13" title="Fig. 13" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 13.</span>
  </div>

  <p>An examination of these two figures shows that they satisfy the rules
  laid down. Each of the curves on being prolonged passes between the other
  two curves. In the case of substances of the first type (Fig. 13), the
  specific volume of the solid is greater than that of the liquid (the
  substance contracts on fusion); the difference of specific volume will,
  therefore, be greatest between liquid and vapour. The curve, therefore,
  for liquid and vapour (or its prolongation) must lie between the other
  two curves; this is seen from the figure to be the case. Similarly, the
  rule is satisfied by the arrangement of curves in Fig. 14, where the
  difference of specific volumes is <!-- Page 57 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page57"></a>{57}</span>greatest between the
  solid and vapour. In this case the curve S-V occupies the intermediate
  position.</p>

  <p>As we see, the two figures differ from one another only in that the
  fusion curve OC in one case slopes to the right away from the pressure
  axis, thus indicating that the melting point is raised by increase of
  pressure; in the other case, to the left, indicating a lowering of the
  melting point with the pressure. These conditions are found exemplified
  in the case of sulphur and ice (<span class="correction" title="Original reads 'pp. 25 and 38'."
  >pp. <a href="#page29">29</a> and <a href="#page35">35</a></span>). We
  see further from the two figures, that O in Fig. 13 gives the highest
  temperature at which the solid can exist, for the curve for
  solid&mdash;liquid slopes back to regions of lower temperature; in Fig.
  14, O gives the lowest temperature at which the liquid phase can exist as
  stable phase.<a name="NtA102" href="#Nt102"><sup>[102]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Theorems of van't Hoff and of Le Chatelier.</b>&mdash;So far we
  have studied only the conditions under which various systems exist in
  equilibrium; and we now pass to a consideration of the changes which take
  place in a system when the external conditions of temperature and
  pressure are altered. For all such changes there exist two theorems,
  based on the laws of thermodynamics, by means of which the alterations in
  a system can be qualitatively predicted.<a name="NtA103"
  href="#Nt103"><sup>[103]</sup></a> The first of these, usually <!-- Page
  58 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page58"></a>{58}</span>known as
  van't Hoff's <i>law of movable equilibrium</i>,<a name="NtA104"
  href="#Nt104"><sup>[104]</sup></a> states: When the temperature of a
  system in equilibrium is raised, that reaction takes place which is
  accompanied by absorption of heat; and, conversely, when the temperature
  is lowered, that reaction occurs which is accompanied by an evolution of
  heat.</p>

  <p>The second of the two theorems refers to the effect of change of
  pressure, and states:<a name="NtA105" href="#Nt105"><sup>[105]</sup></a>
  When the pressure on a system in equilibrium is increased, that reaction
  takes place which is accompanied by a diminution of volume; and when the
  pressure is diminished, a reaction ensues which is accompanied by an
  increase of volume.</p>

  <p>The demonstration of the universal applicability of these two theorems
  is due chiefly to Le Chatelier, who showed that they may be regarded as
  consequences of the general law of action and reaction. For this reason
  they are generally regarded as special cases of the more general law,
  known as the <i>theorem of Le Chatelier</i>, which may be stated in the
  words of Ostwald, as follows:<a name="NtA106"
  href="#Nt106"><sup>[106]</sup></a> <i>If a system in equilibrium is
  subjected to a constraint by which the equilibrium is shifted, a reaction
  takes place which opposes the constraint, </i>i.e.<i> one by which its
  effect is partially destroyed.</i></p>

  <p>This theorem of Le Chatelier is of very great importance, for it
  applies to all systems and changes of the condition of equilibrium,
  whether physical or chemical; to vaporization and fusion; to solution and
  chemical action. In all cases, whenever changes in the external condition
  of a system in equilibrium are produced, processes also occur within the
  system which tend to counteract the effect of the external changes.</p>

  <p><i>Changes at the Triple Point.</i>&mdash;If now we apply this theorem
  to equilibria at the triple point S-L-V, and ask what changes will occur
  in such a system when the external conditions of pressure and temperature
  are altered, the general answer to the question will be: So long as the
  three phases are present, no <!-- Page 59 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page59"></a>{59}</span>change in the temperature or pressure of the
  system can occur, but <i>only changes in the relative amounts of the
  phases</i>; that is to say, the effect on the system of change in the
  external conditions is opposed by the reactions or changes which take
  place within the system (according to the theorems of van't Hoff and Le
  Chatelier). We now proceed to discuss what these changes are, and shall
  consider first the effect of alteration of the temperature at constant
  volume and constant pressure, and then the effect of alteration of the
  pressure both when the temperature remains constant and when it
  varies.</p>

  <p>When the volume is kept constant, the effect of the addition of heat
  to a system at the triple point S-L-V differs somewhat according as there
  is an increase or diminution of volume when the solid passes into the
  liquid state. In the former and most general case (Fig. 14), addition of
  heat will cause a certain amount of the solid phase to melt, whereby the
  heat which is added becomes latent; the temperature of the system
  therefore does not rise. Since, however, the melting of the solid is
  accompanied by an increase of volume, whereby an increase of pressure
  would result, a certain portion of the vapour must condense to liquid, in
  order that the pressure may remain constant. The total effect of addition
  of heat, therefore, is to cause both solid and vapour to pass into
  liquid, <i>i.e.</i> there occurs the change S + V <a
  href="images/singlearrow.png"><img src="images/singlearrow.png"
  class="middle" style="height:2ex" alt="arrow" /></a> L. It will,
  therefore, depend on the relative quantities of solid and vapour, which
  will disappear first. If the solid disappears first, then we shall pass
  to the system L-V; if vapour disappears first, we shall obtain the system
  S-L. Withdrawal of heat causes the reverse change, L <a
  href="images/singlearrow.png"><img src="images/singlearrow.png"
  class="middle" style="height:2ex" alt="arrow" /></a> S + V; at all
  temperatures below the triple point the liquid is unstable or metastable
  (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page30">30</a>).</p>

  <p>When fusion is accompanied by a diminution of volume (<i>e.g.</i> ice,
  Fig. 13), then, since the melting of the solid phase would decrease the
  total volume, <i>i.e.</i> would lower the pressure, a certain quantity of
  the solid must also pass into vapour in order that the pressure may be
  maintained constant. On addition of heat, therefore, there occurs the
  reaction S <a href="images/singlearrow.png"><img
  src="images/singlearrow.png" class="middle" style="height:2ex"
  alt="arrow" /></a> L + V; withdrawal of heat causes the reverse change L
  + V <a href="images/singlearrow.png"><img src="images/singlearrow.png"
  class="middle" style="height:2ex" alt="arrow" /></a> S. Above the
  temperature of the triple point the <!-- Page 60 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page60"></a>{60}</span>solid cannot exist; below
  the triple point both systems, S-L and S-V, can exist, and it will
  therefore depend on the relative amounts of liquid and vapour which of
  these two systems is obtained on withdrawing heat from the system at
  constant volume.</p>

  <p>The same changes in the phases occur when heat is added or withdrawn
  at constant pressure, so long as the three phases are present. Continued
  addition of heat, however, at constant pressure will ultimately cause the
  formation of the bivariant system vapour alone; continued withdrawal of
  heat will ultimately cause the formation of solid alone. This will be
  readily understood from Fig. 15. The dotted line D&prime;OD is a line of
  constant pressure; on adding heat, the system passes along the line OD
  into the region of vapour; on heat being withdrawn, the system passes
  along OD&prime; into the area of solid.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:18%;">
      <a href="images/fig015.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig015.png"
      alt="Fig. 15" title="Fig. 15" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 15.</span>
  </div>

  <p>Similar changes are produced when the volume of the system is altered.
  Alteration of volume may take place either while transference of heat to
  or from the system is cut off (adiabatic change), or while such
  transference may occur (isothermal change). In the latter case, the
  temperature of the system will remain constant; in the former case, since
  at the triple point the pressure must be constant so long as the three
  phases are present, increase of volume must be compensated by the
  evaporation of liquid. This, however, would cause the temperature to fall
  (since communication of heat from the outside is supposed to be cut off),
  and a portion of the liquid must therefore freeze. In this way the latent
  heat of evaporation is counterbalanced by the latent heat of fusion. As
  the result of increase of volume, therefore, the process occurs L <a
  href="images/singlearrow.png"><img src="images/singlearrow.png"
  class="middle" style="height:2ex" alt="arrow" /></a> S + V. Diminution of
  volume, without transference of heat, will bring about the opposite
  change, S + V <a href="images/singlearrow.png"><img
  src="images/singlearrow.png" class="middle" style="height:2ex"
  alt="arrow" /></a> L. In the former case there is ultimately obtained the
  univariant system S-V; in the latter case there will be <!-- Page 61
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page61"></a>{61}</span>obtained either
  S-L or L-V according as the vapour or solid phase disappears first.</p>

  <p>This argument holds good for both types of triple point shown in Figs.
  13 and 14 (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page57">57</a>). A glance at these figures will
  show that increase of volume (diminution of pressure) will lead
  ultimately to the system S-V, for at pressures lower than that of the
  triple point, the liquid phase cannot exist. Decrease of volume (increase
  of pressure), on the other hand, will lead either to the system S-L or
  L-V, because these systems can exist at pressures higher than that of the
  triple point. If the vapour phase disappears and we pass to the curve
  S-L, continued diminution of volume will be accompanied by a fall in
  temperature in the case of systems of the first type (Fig. 13), and by a
  rise in temperature in the case of systems of the second type (Fig.
  14).</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:22%;">
      <a href="images/fig017.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig017.png"
      alt="Fig. 17" title="Fig. 17" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 17.</span>

  <div class="figright" style="width:19%;">

      alt="Fig. 16" title="Fig. 16" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 16.</span>
  </div>

  <p>Lastly, if the temperature is maintained constant, <i>i.e.</i> if heat
  can pass into or out of the system, then on changing the volume the same
  changes in the phases will take place as described above until one of the
  phases has disappeared. Continued increase of volume (decrease of
  pressure) will then cause the disappearance of a second phase, the system
  passing along the dotted line OE&prime; (Figs. 16, 17), so that
  ultimately there remains only the vapour phase. Conversely, diminution of
  volume (increase of pressure) will ultimately lead either to solid (Fig.
  16) or to liquid alone (Fig. 17), the system passing along the dotted
  line OE. <!-- Page 62 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page62"></a>{62}</span></p>

  <p>In discussing the alterations which may take place at the triple point
  with change of temperature and pressure, we have considered only the
  triple point S-L-V. The same reasoning, however, applies, <i>mutatis
  mutandis</i>, to all other triple points, so that if the specific volumes
  of the phases are known, and the sign of the heat effects which accompany
  the transformation of one phase into the other, it is possible to predict
  (by means of the theorem of Le Chatelier) the changes which will be
  produced in the system by alteration of the pressure and temperature.</p>

  <p>In all cases of transformation at the triple point, it should be noted
  that all <i>three phases are involved in the change</i>,<a name="NtA107"
  href="#Nt107"><sup>[107]</sup></a> and not two only; the fact that in the
  case, say, of the transformation from solid to liquid, or liquid to
  solid, at the melting point with change of temperature, only these two
  phases appear to be affected, is due to there generally being a large
  excess of the vapour phase present and to the prior disappearance
  therefore of the solid or liquid phase.</p>

  <p>In the case of triple points at which two solid phases are in
  equilibrium with liquid, other arrangements of the curves around the
  triple point are found. It is, however, unnecessary to give a general
  treatment of these here, since the principles which have been applied to
  the triple point S-L-V can also be applied to the other triple points.<a
  name="NtA108" href="#Nt108"><sup>[108]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Triple Point Solid&mdash;Solid&mdash;Vapour.</b>&mdash;The triple
  point solid&mdash;solid&mdash;vapour is one which is of considerable
  importance. Examples of such a triple point have already been given in
  sulphur and tin, and a list of other substances capable of yielding two
  solid phases is given below. The triple point S-S-V is not precisely the
  same as the transition point, but is very nearly so. The transition point
  is the temperature at which the relative stability of the two solid
  phases undergoes change, when the vapour phase is absent and the pressure
  is 1 atm.; whereas at the triple point the pressure is that of the system
  itself. The transition point, therefore, bears the same relation to the
  triple point S-S-V as the melting point to the triple point S-L-V.</p>

  <p><b>Sublimation and Vaporization Curves.</b>&mdash;We have already
  seen, in the case of ice and liquid water, that the vapour pressure
  increases as the temperature rises, the increase of pressure per degree
  being greater the higher the temperature. The sublimation and
  vaporization curves, therefore, are not straight lines, but are bent, the
  convex side of the curve being towards the temperature axis in the
  ordinary <i>pt</i>-diagram.</p>

  <p>In the case of sulphur and of tin, we assumed vapour to be given off
  by the solid substance, although the pressure of the vapour has not
  hitherto been measured. The assumption, however, is entirely justified,
  not only on theoretical grounds, but also because the existence of a
  vapour pressure has been observed in the case of many solid substances at
  temperatures much below the melting point,<a name="NtA110"
  href="#Nt110"><sup>[110]</sup></a> and in some cases, <i>e.g.</i>
  camphor,<a name="NtA111" href="#Nt111"><sup>[111]</sup></a> the vapour
  pressure is considerable.</p>

<p><!-- Page 64 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page64"></a>{64}</span></p>

  <p>As the result of a large number of determinations, it has been found
  that all vapour pressure curves have the same general form alluded to
  above. Attempts have also been made to obtain a general expression for
  the quantitative changes in the vapour pressure with change of
  temperature, but without success. Nevertheless, the <i>qualitative</i>
  changes, or the general direction of the curves, can be predicted by
  means of the theorem of Le Chatelier.</p>

  <p>As we have already learned (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page16">16</a>), the Phase
  Rule takes no account of the molecular complexity of the substances
  participating in an equilibrium. A dissociating substance, therefore, in
  contact with its vaporous products of dissociation (<i>e.g.</i> ammonium
  chloride in contact with ammonia and hydrogen chloride), will likewise
  constitute a univariant system of one component, provided the composition
  of the vapour phase as a whole is the same as that of the solid or liquid
  phase (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page13">13</a>). For all such substances, therefore,
  the conditions of equilibrium will be represented by a curve of the same
  general form as the vapour pressure curve of a non-dissociating
  substance.<a name="NtA112" href="#Nt112"><sup>[112]</sup></a> The same
  behaviour is also found in the case of substances which polymerize on
  passing into the solid or liquid state (<i>e.g.</i> red phosphorus).
  Where such changes in the molecular state occur, however, the time
  required for equilibrium to be established is, as a rule, greater than
  when the molecular state is the same in both phases.</p>

  <p>From an examination of Figs. 13 and 14, it will be easy to predict the
  effect of change of pressure and temperature on the univariant systems
  S-V or L-V. If the volume is kept constant, addition of heat will cause
  an increase of pressure, the system S-V moving along the curve AO until
  at the triple point the liquid phase is formed, and the system L-V moving
  along the curve OB; so long as two phases are present, the condition of
  the system must be represented by these two curves. Conversely,
  withdrawal of heat will cause condensation of vapour, and therefore
  diminution of pressure; the system will therefore move along the
  vaporization or sublimation curve to lower temperatures and pressures, so
  long as the system remains univariant.</p>

<p><!-- Page 65 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page65"></a>{65}</span></p>

  <p>If transference of heat to or from the system is prevented, increase
  of volume (diminution of pressure) will cause the system L-V to pass
  along the curve BO; liquid will pass into vapour and the temperature will
  fall.<a name="NtA113" href="#Nt113"><sup>[113]</sup></a> At O solid may
  appear, and the temperature of the system will then remain constant until
  the liquid phase has disappeared (<span class="correction"
  title="Original reads 'p. 60'.">p.&nbsp;<a href="#page57">57</a></span>); the
  system will then follow the curve OA until the solid phase disappears,
  and we are ultimately left with vapour. On the other hand, diminution of
  volume (increase of pressure) will cause condensation of vapour, and the
  system S-V will pass along the curve AO to higher temperatures and
  pressures; at O the solid will melt, and the system will ultimately pass
  to the curve OB or to OC (<span class="correction" title="Original reads 'p. 60'."
  >p.&nbsp;<a href="#page57">57</a></span>).</p>

  <p>Addition or withdrawal of heat at constant pressure, and increase or
  diminution of the pressure at constant temperature, will cause the system
  to pass along lines parallel to the temperature and the pressure axis
  respectively; the working out of these changes may be left to the reader,
  guided by what has been said on pp. 60 and 61.</p>

  <p>The sublimation curve of all substances, so far as yet found, has its
  upper limit at the melting point (triple point), although the possibility
  of the existence of a superheated solid is not excluded. The lower limit
  is, theoretically at least, at the absolute zero, provided no new phase,
  <i>e.g.</i> a different crystalline modification, is formed. If the
  sublimation pressure of a substance is greater than the atmospheric
  pressure at any temperature below the point of fusion, then the substance
  will <i>sublime without melting</i> when heated in an open vessel; and
  fusion will be possible only at a pressure higher than the atmospheric.
  This is found, for example, in the case of red phosphorus (p.&nbsp;<a
  href="#page47">47</a>). If, however, the sublimation pressure of a
  substance at its triple point S-L-V is less than one atmosphere, then the
  substance will melt when heated in an open vessel.</p>

  <p>In the case of the vaporization curve, the upper limit lies at the
  critical point where the liquid ceases to exist;<a name="NtA114"
  href="#Nt114"><sup>[114]</sup></a> the <!-- Page 66 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page66"></a>{66}</span>lower limit is determined
  by the range of the metastable state of the supercooled liquid.</p>

  <p>The interpolation and extrapolation of vapour-pressure curves is
  rendered very easy by means of a relationship which Ramsay and Young<a
  name="NtA115" href="#Nt115"><sup>[115]</sup></a> found to exist between
  the vapour-pressure curves of different substances. It was observed that
  in the case of closely related substances, the ratio of the absolute
  temperatures corresponding to equal vapour pressures is constant,
  <i>i.e.</i> T<sub>1</sub>/T&prime;<sub>1</sub> =
  T<sub>2</sub>/T&prime;<sub>2</sub>. When the two substances are not
  closely related, it was found that the relationship could be expressed by
  the equation T<sub>1</sub>/T&prime;<sub>1</sub> =
  T<sub>2</sub>/T&prime;<sub>2</sub> + <i>c</i>(<i>t</i>&prime; - <i>t</i>)
  where <i>c</i> is a constant having a small positive or negative value,
  and <i>t</i>&prime; and <i>t</i> are the temperatures at which one of the
  substances has the two values of the vapour pressure in question. By
  means of this equation, if the vapour-pressure curve of one substance is
  known, the vapour-pressure curve of any other substance can be calculated
  from the values at any two temperatures of the vapour pressure of that
  substance.</p>

  <p><b>Fusion Curve&mdash;Transition Curve.</b>&mdash;The fusion curve
  represents the conditions of equilibrium between the solid and liquid
  phase; it shows the change of the melting point of a substance with
  change of pressure.</p>

  <p>As shown in Figs. 13 and 14, the fusion curve is inclined either
  towards the pressure axis or away from it; that is, increase of pressure
  can either lower or raise the melting point. It is easy to predict in a
  qualitative manner the different effect of pressure on the melting point
  in the two cases mentioned, if we consider the matter in the light of the
  theorem of Le Chatelier (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page58">58</a>). Water, on passing
  into ice, expands; therefore, if the pressure on the system
  ice&mdash;water be increased, a reaction will take place which is
  accompanied by a diminution in volume, <i>i.e.</i> the ice will melt.
  Consequently, a lower temperature will be required in order to counteract
  the effect of increase of pressure; or, in other words, the melting point
  will <!-- Page 67 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page67"></a>{67}</span>be lowered by pressure.<a name="NtA116"
  href="#Nt116"><sup>[116]</sup></a> In the second case, the passage of the
  liquid to the solid state is accompanied by a diminution of volume; the
  effect of increase of pressure will therefore be the reverse of that in
  the previous case.</p>

  <p>If the value of the heat of fusion and the alteration of volume
  accompanying the change of state are known, it is possible to calculate
  <i>quantitatively</i> the effect of pressure.<a name="NtA117"
  href="#Nt117"><sup>[117]</sup></a></p>

  <p>We have already seen (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page25">25</a>) that the effect of
  pressure on the melting point of a substance was predicted as the result
  of theoretical considerations, and was first proved experimentally in the
  case of ice. Soon after, Bunsen<a name="NtA118"
  href="#Nt118"><sup>[118]</sup></a> showed that the melting point of other
  substances is also affected by pressure; and in more recent years, ample
  experimental proof of the change of the melting point with the pressure
  has been obtained. The change of the melting point is, however, small; as
  a rule, increase of pressure by 1 atm. changes the melting point by about
  0.03°, but in the case of water the change is much less (0.0076°), and in
  the case of camphor much more (0.13°). In other words, if we take the
  mean case, an increase of pressure of more than 30 atm. is required to
  produce a change in the melting point of 1°.</p>

  <p>Investigations which were made of the influence of pressure on the
  melting-point, showed that up to pressures of several hundred atmospheres
  the fusion curve is a straight line.<a name="NtA119"
  href="#Nt119"><sup>[119]</sup></a> Tammann<a name="NtA120"
  href="#Nt120"><sup>[120]</sup></a> has, however, found that on increasing
  the pressure the fusion curve no longer remains straight, but bends
  towards the pressure axis, so that, on sufficiently increasing the
  pressure, a maximum temperature might at length be reached. This maximum
  has, so far, however, not been attained, although the melting point
  curves of various substances have been studied up to pressures of 4500
  atm. This is to be accounted for partly <!-- Page 68 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page68"></a>{68}</span>by the fact that the
  probable maximum temperature in the case of most substances lies at very
  great pressures, and also by the fact that other solid phases make their
  appearance, as, for example, in the case of ice (p.&nbsp;<a
  href="#page32">32</a>).</p>

  <p>As to the upper limit of the fusion curve, the view has been
  expressed<a name="NtA121" href="#Nt121"><sup>[121]</sup></a> that just as
  in the case of liquid and vapour, so also in the case of solid and
  liquid, there exists a critical point at which the solid and the liquid
  phase become identical. Experimental evidence, however, does not appear
  to favour this view.<a name="NtA122"
  href="#Nt122"><sup>[122]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The <i>transition point</i>, like the melting point, is also
  influenced by the pressure, and in this case also it is found that
  pressure may either raise or lower the transition point, so that the
  transition curve may be inclined either away from or towards the pressure
  axis. The direction of the transition curve can also be predicted if the
  change of volume accompanying the passage of one form into the other is
  known. In the case of sulphur, we saw that the transition point is raised
  by increase of pressure; in the case of the transition of rhombohedral
  into <span class="grk">&alpha;</span>-rhombic form of ammonium nitrate,
  however, the transition point is lowered by pressure, as shown by the
  following table.<a name="NtA123" href="#Nt123"><sup>[123]</sup></a></p>

  <p>So far as investigations have been carried out, it appears that in
  most cases the transition curve is practically a straight line.</p>

  <p>It has, however, been found in the case of Glauber's salt, that with
  increase of pressure the transition curve passes through a point of
  maximum temperature, and exhibits, therefore, a form similar to that
  assumed by Tammann for the fusion curve.<a name="NtA124"
  href="#Nt124"><sup>[124]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 69 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page69"></a>{69}</span></p>

  <p><b>Suspended Transformation. Metastable Equilibria.</b>&mdash;Hitherto
  we have considered only systems in stable equilibrium. We have, however,
  already seen, in the case of water, that on cooling the liquid down to
  the triple point, solidification did not necessarily take place, although
  the conditions were such as to allow of its formation. Similarly, we saw
  that rhombic sulphur can be heated above the transition point, and
  monoclinic sulphur can be obtained at temperatures below the transition
  point, although in both cases transformation into a more stable form is
  possible; the system becomes metastable.</p>

  <p>The same reluctance to form a new phase is observed also in the
  phenomena of superheating of liquids, and in the "hanging" of mercury in
  barometers, in which case the vapour phase is not formed. In general,
  then, we may say that <i>a new phase will not necessarily be formed
  immediately the system passes into such a condition that the existence of
  that phase is possible</i>; but rather, instead of the system undergoing
  transformation so as to pass into the most stable condition under the
  existing pressure and temperature, this transformation will be
  "suspended" or delayed, and the system will become metastable. Only in
  the case of the formation of the liquid from the solid phase, in a
  one-component system, has this reluctance to form a new phase not been
  observed.</p>

  <p><i>To ensure the formation of the new phase, it is necessary to have
  that phase present.</i> The presence of the solid phase will prevent the
  supercooling of the liquid; and the presence of the vapour phase will
  prevent the superheating of the liquid. However, even in the presence of
  the more stable phase, transformation of the metastable phase occurs with
  very varying velocity; in some cases so quickly as to appear almost
  instantaneous; while in other cases, the change takes place so slowly as
  to require hundreds of years for its achievement. It is this slow rate of
  transformation that renders the existence of metastable forms possible,
  when in contact with the more stable phase. Thus, for example, although
  calcite is the most stable form of calcium carbonate at the ordinary
  temperature,<a name="NtA125" href="#Nt125"><sup>[125]</sup></a> the less
  stable <!-- Page 70 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page70"></a>{70}</span>modification, aragonite, nevertheless exists
  under the ordinary conditions in an apparently very stable state.</p>

  <p>As to the amount of the new phase required to bring about the
  transformation of the metastable phase, quantitative measurements have
  been carried out only in the case of the initiation of crystallization in
  a supercooled liquid.<a name="NtA126" href="#Nt126"><sup>[126]</sup></a>
  As the result of these investigations, it was found that, in the case of
  superfused salol, the very small amount of 1 × 10<sup>-7</sup> gm. of the
  solid phase was sufficient to induce crystallization. Crystallization of
  a supercooled liquid, however, can be initiated only by a "nucleus" of
  the same substance in the solid state, or, as has also been found, by a
  nucleus of an isomorphous solid phase; it is not brought about by the
  presence of any chance solid.</p>

  <p><b>Velocity of Transformation.</b>&mdash;Attention has already been
  drawn to the sluggishness with which reciprocal transformation of the
  polymorphic forms of a substance may occur. In the case of tin, for
  example, it was found that the white modification, although apparently
  possessing permanence, is in reality in a metastable state, under the
  ordinary conditions of temperature and pressure. This great degree of
  stability is due to the tardiness with which transformation into the grey
  form occurs.</p>

  <p>What was found in the case of tin, is met with also in the case of all
  transformations in the solid state, but the velocity of the change is
  less in some cases than in others, and appears to decrease with increase
  of the valency of the element.<a name="NtA127"
  href="#Nt127"><sup>[127]</sup></a> To this fact van't Hoff attributes the
  great permanence of many really unstable (or metastable) carbon
  compounds.</p>

  <p>Reference has been made to the fact that the velocity of
  transformation can be accelerated by various means. One of the most
  important of these is the employment of a liquid which has a solvent
  action on the solid phases. Just as we have seen that at any given
  temperature the less stable form has the higher vapour pressure, but that
  at the transition point the vapour pressure of both forms becomes
  identical, so also it can be proved theoretically, and be shown
  experimentally, that <!-- Page 71 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page71"></a>{71}</span>at a given temperature the solubility of the
  less stable form is greater than that of the more stable, but that at the
  transition point the solubility of the two forms becomes identical.<a
  name="NtA128" href="#Nt128"><sup>[128]</sup></a></p>

  <p>If, then, the two solid phases are brought into contact with a
  solvent, the less stable phase will dissolve more abundantly than the
  more stable; the solution will therefore become supersaturated with
  respect to the latter, which will be deposited. A gradual change of the
  less stable form, therefore, takes place through the medium of the
  solvent. In this way the more rapid conversion of white tin into grey in
  presence of a solution of tin ammonium chloride (p.&nbsp;<a
  href="#page42">42</a>) is to be explained. Although, as a rule, solvents
  accelerate the transformation of one solid phase into the other, they may
  also have a retarding influence on the velocity of transformation, as was
  found by Reinders in the case of mercuric iodide.<a name="NtA129"
  href="#Nt129"><sup>[129]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The velocity of inversion, also, is variously affected by different
  solvents, and in some cases, at least, it appears to be slower the more
  viscous the solvent;<a name="NtA130" href="#Nt130"><sup>[130]</sup></a>
  indeed, Kastle and Reed state that yellow crystals of mercuric iodide,
  which, ordinarily, change with considerable velocity into the red
  modification, have been preserved for more than a year under
  vaseline.</p>

  <p>Temperature, also, has a very considerable influence on the velocity
  of transformation. The higher the temperature, and the farther it is
  removed from the equilibrium point (transition point), the greater is the
  velocity of change. Above the transition point, these two factors act in
  the same direction, and the velocity of transformation will therefore go
  on increasing indefinitely the higher the temperature is raised. Below
  the transition point, however, the two factors act in opposite
  directions, and the more the temperature is lowered, the more is the
  effect of removal from the equilibrium point counteracted. A point will
  therefore be reached at which the velocity is a maximum. Reduction of the
  temperature <!-- Page 72 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page72"></a>{72}</span>below this point causes a rapid falling off
  in the velocity of change. The point of maximum velocity, however, is not
  definite, but may be altered by various causes. Thus, Cohen found that in
  the case of tin, the point of maximum velocity was altered if the metal
  had already undergone transformation; and also by the presence of
  different liquids.<a name="NtA131" href="#Nt131"><sup>[131]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Lastly, the presence of small quantities of different
  substances&mdash;catalytic agents or catalyzers&mdash;has a great
  influence on the velocity of transformation. Thus, <i>e.g.</i>, the
  conversion of white to red phosphorus is accelerated by the presence of
  iodine (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page47">47</a>).</p>

  <p>Greater attention, however, has been paid to the study of the velocity
  of crystallization of a supercooled liquid, the first experiments in this
  direction having been made by Gernez<a name="NtA132"
  href="#Nt132"><sup>[132]</sup></a> on the velocity of crystallization of
  phosphorus and sulphur. Since that time, the velocity of crystallization
  of other supercooled liquids has been investigated; such as acetic acid
  and phenol by Moore;<a name="NtA133" href="#Nt133"><sup>[133]</sup></a>
  supercooled water by Tumlirz;<a name="NtA134"
  href="#Nt134"><sup>[134]</sup></a> and a number of organic substances by
  Tammann,<a name="NtA135" href="#Nt135"><sup>[135]</sup></a> Friedländer
  and Tammann,<a name="NtA136" href="#Nt136"><sup>[136]</sup></a> and by
  Bogojawlenski.<a name="NtA137" href="#Nt137"><sup>[137]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In measuring the velocity of crystallization, the supercooled liquids
  were contained in narrow glass tubes, and the time required for the
  crystallization to advance along a certain length of the tube was
  determined, the velocity being expressed in millimetres per minute. The
  results which have so far been obtained may be summarized as follows. For
  any given degree of supercooling of a substance, the velocity of
  crystallization is constant. As the degree of supercooling increases, the
  velocity of crystallization also increases, until a certain point is
  reached at which the velocity is a maximum, which has a definite
  characteristic value for each substance. This maximum velocity remains
  constant over a certain range of <!-- Page 73 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page73"></a>{73}</span>temperature; thereafter, the velocity
  diminishes fairly rapidly, and, with sufficient supercooling, may become
  zero. The liquid then passes into a glassy mass, which will remain
  (practically) permanent even in contact with the crystalline solid.</p>

  <p>In ordinary glass we have a familiar example of a liquid which has
  been cooled to a temperature at which crystallization takes place with
  very great slowness. If, however, glass is heated, a temperature is
  reached, much below the melting point of the glass, at which
  crystallization occurs with appreciable velocity, and we observe the
  phenomenon of devitrification.<a name="NtA138"
  href="#Nt138"><sup>[138]</sup></a></p>

  <p>When the velocity of crystallization is studied at temperatures above
  the maximum point, it is found that the velocity is diminished by the
  addition of foreign substances; and in many cases, indeed, it has been
  found that the diminution is the same for equimolecular quantities of
  different substances. It would hence appear possible to utilize this
  behaviour as a method for determining molecular weights.<a name="NtA139"
  href="#Nt139"><sup>[139]</sup></a> The rule is, however, by no means a
  universal one. Thus it has been found by F. Dreyer,<a name="NtA140"
  href="#Nt140"><sup>[140]</sup></a> in studying the velocity of
  crystallization of formanilide, that the diminution in the velocity
  produced by equivalent amounts of different substances is not the same,
  but that the foreign substances exercise a specific influence. Further,
  von Pickardt's rule does not hold when the foreign substance forms mixed
  crystals (Chap. X.) with the crystallizing substance.<a name="NtA141"
  href="#Nt141"><sup>[141]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Law of Successive Reactions.</b>&mdash;When sulphur vapour is
  cooled at the ordinary temperature, it first of all condenses to drops of
  liquid, which solidify in an amorphous form, and only after some time
  undergo crystallization; or, when phosphorus vapour is condensed, white
  phosphorus is first formed, and not the more stable form&mdash;red
  phosphorus. It has also been observed that even at the ordinary
  temperature (therefore much below the transition point) sulphur may
  crystallize out from solution in benzene, alcohol, carbon disulphide, and
  other <!-- Page 74 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page74"></a>{74}</span>solvents, in the prismatic form, the less
  stable prismatic crystals then undergoing transformation into the rhombic
  form;<a name="NtA142" href="#Nt142"><sup>[142]</sup></a> a similar
  behaviour has also been observed in the transformation of the monotropic
  crystalline forms of sulphur.<a name="NtA143"
  href="#Nt143"><sup>[143]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Many other examples might be given. In organic chemistry, for
  instance, it is often found that when a substance is thrown out of
  solution, it is first deposited as a liquid, which passes later into the
  more stable crystalline form. In analysis, also, rapid precipitation from
  concentrated solution often causes the separation of a less stable and
  more soluble amorphous form.</p>

  <p>On account of the great frequency with which the prior formation of
  the less stable form occurs, Ostwald<a name="NtA144"
  href="#Nt144"><sup>[144]</sup></a> has put forward the <i>law of
  successive reactions</i>, which states that when a system passes from a
  less stable condition it does not pass directly into the most stable of
  the possible states; but into the next more stable, and so step by step
  into the most stable. This law explains the formation of the metastable
  forms of monotropic substances, which would otherwise not be obtainable.
  Although it is not always possible to observe the formation of the least
  stable form, it should be remembered that that may quite conceivably be
  due to the great velocity of transformation of the less stable into the
  more stable form. From what we have learned about the velocity of
  transformation of metastable phases, we can understand that rapid cooling
  to a low temperature will tend to preserve the less stable form; and, on
  account of the influence of temperature in increasing the velocity of
  change, it can be seen that the formation of the less stable form will be
  more difficult to observe in superheated than in supercooled systems. The
  factors, however, which affect the readiness with which <!-- Page 75
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page75"></a>{75}</span>the less stable
  modification is produced, appear to be rather various.<a name="NtA145"
  href="#Nt145"><sup>[145]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Although a number of at least apparent exceptions to Ostwald's law
  have been found, it may nevertheless be accepted as a very useful
  generalization which sums up very frequently observed phenomena.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>

<p class="cenhead">SYSTEMS OF TWO COMPONENTS&mdash;PHENOMENA OF
DISSOCIATION</p>

  <p>In the preceding pages we have studied the behaviour of systems
  consisting of only one component, or systems in which all the phases,
  whether solid, liquid, or vapour, had the same chemical composition
  (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page13">13</a>). In some cases, as, for example, in the
  case of phosphorus and sulphur, the component was an elementary
  substance; in other cases, however, <i>e.g.</i> water, the component was
  a compound. The systems which we now proceed to study are characterized
  by the fact that the different phases have no longer all the same
  chemical composition, and cannot, therefore, according to definition, be
  considered as one-component systems.</p>

  <p>In most cases, little or no difficulty will be experienced in deciding
  as to the <i>number</i> of the components, if the rules given on pp. <a
  href="#page12">12</a> and <a href="#page13">13</a> are borne in mind. If
  the composition of all the phases, each regarded as a whole, is the same,
  the system is to be regarded as of the first order, or a one-component
  system; if the composition of the different phases varies, the system
  must contain more than one component. If, in order to <i>express</i> the
  composition of all the phases present when the system is in equilibrium,
  two of the constituents participating in the equilibrium are necessary
  and sufficient, the system is one of two components. Which two of the
  possible substances are to be regarded as components will, however, be to
  a certain extent a matter of arbitrary choice.</p>

  <p>The principles affecting the choice of components will best be learned
  by a study of the examples to be discussed in the sequel. <!-- Page 77
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page77"></a>{77}</span></p>

  <p><b>Different Systems of Two Components.</b>&mdash;Applying the Phase
  Rule</p>

<p class="cenhead">P + F = C + 2</p>

  <p>to systems of two components, we see that in order that the system may
  be invariant, there must be four phases in equilibrium together; two
  components in three phases constitute a univariant, two components in two
  phases a bivariant system. In the case of systems of one component, the
  highest degree of variability found was two (one component in one phase);
  but, as is evident from the formula, there is a higher degree of freedom
  possible in the case of two-component systems. Two components existing in
  only one phase constitute a tervariant system, or a system with three
  degrees of freedom. In addition to the pressure and temperature,
  therefore, a third variable factor must be chosen, and as such there is
  taken the <i>concentration of the components</i>. In systems of two
  components, therefore, not only may there be change of pressure and
  temperature, as in the case of one-component systems, but the
  concentration of the components in the different phases may also alter; a
  variation which did not require to be considered in the case of
  one-component systems.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:33%;">
      <a href="images/fig018.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig018.png"
      alt="Fig. 18" title="Fig. 18" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 18.
  </div>

  <p>Since a two-component system may undergo three possible <!-- Page 78
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page78"></a>{78}</span>independent
  variations, we should require for the graphic representation of all the
  possible conditions of equilibrium a system of three co-ordinates in
  space, three axes being chosen, say, at right angles to one another, and
  representing the three variables&mdash;pressure, temperature, and
  concentration of components (Fig. 18). A curve (<i>e.g.</i> AB) in the
  plane containing the pressure and temperature axes would then represent
  the change of pressure with the temperature, the concentration remaining
  unaltered (<i>pt</i>-diagram); one in the plane containing the pressure
  and concentration axes (<i>e.g.</i> AF or DF), the change of pressure
  with the concentration, the temperature remaining constant
  (<i>pc</i>-diagram), while in the plane containing the concentration and
  the temperature axes, the simultaneous change of these two factors at
  constant pressure would be represented (<i>tc</i>-diagram). If the points
  on these three curves are joined together, a surface, ABDE, will be
  formed, and any line on that surface (<i>e.g.</i> FG, or GH, or GI) would
  represent the simultaneous variation of the three factors&mdash;pressure,
  temperature, concentration. Although we shall at a later point make some
  use of these solid figures, we shall for the present employ the more
  readily intelligible plane diagram.</p>

  <p>The number of different systems which can be formed from two
  components, as well as the number of the different phenomena which can
  there be observed, is much greater than in the case of one component. In
  the case of no two substances, however, have all the possible
  relationships been studied; so that for the purpose of gaining an insight
  into the very varied behaviour of two-component systems, a number of
  different examples will be discussed, each of which will serve to give a
  picture of some of the relationships.</p>

  <p>Although the strict classification of the different systems according
  to the Phase Rule would be based on the variability of the systems, the
  study of the many different phenomena, and the correlation of the
  comparatively large number of different systems, will probably be
  rendered easiest by grouping these different phenomena into classes, each
  of these classes being studied with the help of one or more typical
  examples. The order of treatment adopted here is, of course, quite
  arbitrary; <!-- Page 79 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page79"></a>{79}</span>but has been selected from considerations of
  simplicity and clearness.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Phenomena of Dissociation.</span></p>

  <p><b>Bivariant Systems.</b>&mdash;As the first examples of the
  equilibria between a substance and its products of dissociation, we shall
  consider very briefly those cases in which there is one solid phase in
  equilibrium with vapour. Reference has already been made to such systems
  in the case of ammonium chloride. On being heated, ammonium chloride
  dissociates into ammonia and hydrogen chloride. Since, however, in that
  case the vapour phase has the same total composition as the solid phase,
  viz. NH<sub>3</sub> + HCl = NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, the system consists of only
  one component existing in two phases; it is therefore univariant, and to
  each temperature there will correspond a definite vapour pressure
  (dissociation pressure).<a name="NtA146"
  href="#Nt146"><sup>[146]</sup></a></p>

  <p>If, however, excess of one of the products of dissociation be added,
  the system becomes one of two components.</p>

  <p>In the first place, analysis of each of the two phases yields as the
  composition of each, solid: NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (= NH<sub>3</sub> + HCl);
  vapour: <i>m</i>NH<sub>3</sub> + <i>n</i>HCl. Obviously the smallest
  number of substances by which the composition of the two phases can be
  expressed is two; that is, the number of components is two. What, then,
  are the components? The choice lies between NH<sub>3</sub> + HCl,
  NH<sub>4</sub>Cl + NH<sub>3</sub>, and NH<sub>4</sub>Cl + HCl; for the
  three substances, ammonium chloride, ammonia, hydrogen chloride, are the
  only ones taking part in the equilibrium of the system.</p>

  <p>Of these three pairs of components, we should obviously choose as the
  most simple NH<sub>3</sub> and HCl, for we can then represent the
  composition of the two phases as the <i>sum</i> of the two components. If
  one of the other two possible pairs of components be chosen, we should
  have to introduce negative quantities of one of the components, in order
  to represent the composition of the vapour phase. Although it must be
  allowed that the introduction of negative quantities of a component in
  such cases is quite permissible, still it will be <!-- Page 80 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page80"></a>{80}</span>better to adopt the
  simpler and more direct choice, whereby the composition of each of the
  phases is represented as a sum of two components in varying proportions
  (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page12">12</a>).</p>

  <p>If, therefore, we have a solid substance, such as ammonium chloride,
  which dissociates on volatilization, and if the products of dissociation
  are added in varying amounts to the system, we shall have, in the sense
  of the Phase Rule, a <i>two-component system existing in two phases</i>.
  Such a system will possess two degrees of freedom. At any given
  temperature, not only the pressure, but also the composition, of the
  vapour-phase, <i>i.e.</i> the concentration of the components, can vary.
  Only after one of these independent variables, pressure or composition,
  has been arbitrarily fixed does the system become univariant, and exhibit
  a definite, constant pressure at a given temperature.</p>

  <p>Now, although the Phase Rule informs us that at a given temperature
  change of composition of the vapour phase will be accompanied by change
  of pressure, it does not cast any light on the relation between these two
  variables. This relationship, however, can be calculated theoretically by
  means of the Law of Mass Action.<a name="NtA147"
  href="#Nt147"><sup>[147]</sup></a> From this we learn that in the case of
  a substance which dissociates into equivalent quantities of two gases,
  the product of the partial pressures of the gases is constant at a given
  temperature.</p>

  <p>This has been proved experimentally in the case of ammonium
  hydrosulphide, ammonium cyanide, phosphonium bromide, and other
  substances.<a name="NtA148" href="#Nt148"><sup>[148]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Univariant Systems.</b>&mdash;In order that a system of two
  components shall possess only one degree of freedom, three phases must be
  present. Of such systems, there are seven possible, viz. S-S-S, S-S-L,
  S-S-V, L-L-L, S-L-L, L-L-V, S-L-V; S denoting solid, L liquid, and V
  vapour. In the present chapter we shall consider only the systems S-S-V,
  <i>i.e.</i> those systems in which there are two solid phases and a
  vapour phase present.</p>

<p><!-- Page 81 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page81"></a>{81}</span></p>

  <p>As an example of this, we may first consider the well-known case of
  the dissociation of calcium carbonate. This substance on being heated
  dissociates into calcium oxide, or quick-lime, and carbon dioxide, as
  shown by the equation CaCO<sub>3</sub> <a
  href="images/doublearrow.png"><img src="images/doublearrow.png"
  class="middle" style="height:2.5ex" alt="reversible arrow" /></a> CaO +
  CO<sub>2</sub>. In accordance with our definition (p.&nbsp;<a
  href="#page9">9</a>), we have here two solid phases, the carbonate and
  the quick-lime, and one vapour phase; the system is therefore univariant.
  To each temperature, therefore, there will correspond a certain, definite
  maximum pressure of carbon dioxide (dissociation pressure), and this will
  follow the same law as the vapour pressure of a pure liquid (p.&nbsp;<a
  href="#page21">21</a>). More particularly, it will be independent of the
  relative or absolute amounts of the two solid phases, and of the volume
  of the vapour phase. If the temperature is maintained constant, increase
  of volume will cause the dissociation of a further amount of the
  carbonate until the pressure again reaches its maximum value
  corresponding to the given temperature. Diminution of volume, on the
  other hand, will bring about the combination of a certain quantity of the
  carbon dioxide with the calcium oxide until the pressure again reaches
  its original value.</p>

  <p>The dissociation pressure of calcium carbonate was first studied by
  Debray,<a name="NtA149" href="#Nt149"><sup>[149]</sup></a> but more exact
  measurements have been made by Le Chatelier,<a name="NtA150"
  href="#Nt150"><sup>[150]</sup></a> who found the following corresponding
  values of temperature and pressure:&mdash;</p>

</table>

  <p>From this table we see that it is only at a temperature of about 812°
  that the pressure of the carbon dioxide becomes equal to atmospheric
  pressure. In a vessel open to <!-- Page 82 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page82"></a>{82}</span>the air, therefore, the complete
  decomposition of the calcium carbonate would not take place below this
  temperature by the mere heating of the carbonate. If, however, the carbon
  dioxide is removed as quickly as it is formed, say by a current of air,
  then the entire decomposition can be made to take place at a much lower
  temperature. For the dissociation equilibrium of the carbonate depends
  only on the partial pressure of the carbon dioxide, and if this is kept
  small, then the decomposition can proceed, even at a temperature below
  that at which the pressure of the carbon dioxide is less than atmospheric
  pressure.</p>

  <p><b>Ammonia Compounds of Metal Chlorides.</b>&mdash;Ammonia possesses
  the property of combining with various substances, chiefly the halides of
  metals, to form compounds which again yield up the ammonia on being
  heated. Thus, for example, on passing ammonia over silver chloride,
  absorption of the gas takes place with formation of the substances
  AgCl,3NH<sub>3</sub> and 2AgCl,3NH<sub>3</sub>, according to the
  conditions of the experiment. These were the first known substances
  belonging to this class, and were employed by Faraday in his experiments
  on the liquefaction of ammonia. Similar compounds have also been obtained
  by the action of ammonia on silver bromide, iodide, cyanide, and nitrate;
  and with the halogen compounds of calcium, zinc, and magnesium, as well
  as with other salts. The behaviour of the ammonia compounds of silver
  chloride is typical for the compounds of this class, and may be briefly
  considered here.</p>

  <p>It was found by Isambert<a name="NtA151"
  href="#Nt151"><sup>[151]</sup></a> that at temperatures below 15°, silver
  chloride combined with ammonia to form the compound AgCl,3NH<sub>3</sub>,
  while at temperatures above 20° the compound 2AgCl,3NH<sub>3</sub> was
  produced. On heating these substances, ammonia was evolved, and the
  pressure of this gas was found in the case of both compounds to be
  constant at a given temperature, but was greater in the case of the
  former than in the case of the latter substance; the pressure, further,
  was independent of the amount decomposed. The behaviour of these two
  substances is, therefore, exactly analogous to that shown by calcium
  carbonate, and the explanation is also similar.</p>

<p><!-- Page 83 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page83"></a>{83}</span></p>

  <p>Regarded from the point of view of the Phase Rule, we see that we are
  here dealing with two components, AgCl and NH<sub>3</sub>. On being
  heated, the compounds decompose according to the equations:&mdash;</p>

<p class="cenhead">2(AgCl,3NH<sub>3</sub>) <a href="images/doublearrow.png"><img src="images/doublearrow.png" class="middle" style="height:2.5ex" alt="reversible arrow" /></a> 2AgCl,3NH<sub>3</sub> + 3NH<sub>3</sub>.<br />
  2AgCl,3NH<sub>3</sub> <a href="images/doublearrow.png"><img src="images/doublearrow.png" class="middle" style="height:2.5ex" alt="reversible arrow" /></a> 2AgCl + 3NH<sub>3</sub>. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

  <p>There are, therefore, three phases, viz. AgCl,3NH<sub>3</sub>;
  2AgCl,3NH<sub>3</sub>, and NH<sub>3</sub>, in the one case; and
  2AgCl,3NH<sub>3</sub>; AgCl, and NH<sub>3</sub> in the other. These two
  systems are therefore univariant, and to each temperature there must
  correspond a definite pressure of dissociation, quite irrespective of the
  amounts of the phases present. Similarly, if, at constant temperature,
  the volume is increased (or if the ammonia which is evolved is pumped
  off), the pressure will remain constant so long as two solid phases,
  AgCl,3NH<sub>3</sub> and 2AgCl,3NH<sub>3</sub>, are present, <i>i.e.</i>
  until the compound richer in ammonia is completely decomposed, when there
  will be a sudden fall in the pressure to the value corresponding to the
  system 2AgCl,3NH<sub>3</sub>&mdash;AgCl&mdash;NH<sub>3</sub>. The
  pressure will again remain constant at constant temperature, until all
  the ammonia has been pumped off, when there will again be a sudden fall
  in the pressure to that of the system formed by solid silver chloride in
  contact with its vapour.</p>

  <p>The reverse changes take place when the pressure of the ammonia is
  gradually increased. If the volume is continuously diminished, the
  pressure will first increase until it has reached a certain value; the
  compound 2AgCl,3NH<sub>3</sub> can then be formed, and the pressure will
  now remain constant until all the silver chloride has disappeared. The
  pressure will again rise, until it has reached the value at which the
  compound AgCl,3NH<sub>3</sub> can be formed, when it will again remain
  constant until the complete disappearance of the lower compound. <i>There
  is no gradual change of pressure</i> on passing from one system to
  another; but the changes are abrupt, as is demanded by the Phase Rule,
  and as experiment has conclusively proved.<a name="NtA152"
  href="#Nt152"><sup>[152]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The conditions for the formation of these two compounds, by passing
  ammonia over silver chloride, to which reference has already been made,
  will be readily understood from the above tables. In the case of the
  triammonia mono-chloride, the dissociation pressure becomes equal to
  atmospheric pressure at a temperature of about 20°; above this
  temperature, therefore, it cannot be formed by the action of ammonia at
  atmospheric pressure on silver chloride. The triammonia dichloride can,
  however, be formed, for its dissociation pressure at this temperature
  amounts to only 9 cm., and becomes equal to the atmospheric pressure only
  at a temperature of about 68°; and this temperature, therefore,
  constitutes the limit above which no combination can take place between
  silver chloride and ammonia under atmospheric pressure.</p>

  <p>Attention may be here drawn to the fact, to which reference will also
  be made later, that <i>two</i> solid phases are necessary in order that
  the dissociation pressure at a given temperature shall be definite;
  <i>and for the exact definition of this pressure it is necessary to know,
  not merely what is the substance undergoing dissociation, but also what
  is the solid product of dissociation formed</i>. For the definition of
  the equilibrium, the latter is as important as the former. We shall
  presently find proof of this in the case <!-- Page 85 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page85"></a>{85}</span>of an analogous class of
  phenomena, viz. the dissociation of salt hydrates.</p>

  <p><b>Salts with Water of Crystallization.</b>&mdash;In the case of the
  dehydration of crystalline salts containing water of crystallization, we
  meet with phenomena which are in all respects similar to those just
  studied. A salt hydrate on being heated dissociates into a lower hydrate
  (or anhydrous salt) and water vapour. Since we are dealing with two
  components&mdash;salt and water<a name="NtA154"
  href="#Nt154"><sup>[154]</sup></a>&mdash;in three phases, viz. hydrate
  <i>a</i>, hydrate <i>b</i> (or anhydrous salt), and vapour, the system is
  univariant, and to each temperature there will correspond a certain,
  definite vapour pressure (the dissociation pressure), which will be
  independent of the relative or absolute amounts of the phases,
  <i>i.e.</i> of the amount of hydrate which has already undergone
  dissociation or dehydration.</p>

  <p>The constancy of the dissociation pressure had been proved
  experimentally by several investigators<a name="NtA155"
  href="#Nt155"><sup>[155]</sup></a> a number of years before the
  theoretical basis for its necessity had been given. In the case of salts
  capable of forming more than one hydrate, we should obtain a series of
  dissociation curves (<i>pt</i>-curves), as in the case of the different
  hydrates of copper sulphate. In Fig. 19 there are represented
  diagrammatically the vapour-pressure curves of the following univariant
  systems of copper sulphate and water:&mdash;</p>

  <p>Let us now follow the changes which take place on <!-- Page 86
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page86"></a>{86}</span>increasing the
  pressure of the aqueous vapour in contact with anhydrous copper sulphate,
  the temperature being meanwhile maintained constant. If, starting from
  the point D, we slowly add water vapour to the system, the pressure will
  gradually rise, without formation of hydrate taking place; for at
  pressures below the curve OC only the anhydrous salt can exist. At E,
  however, the hydrate CuSO<sub>4</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O will be formed, and
  as there are now three phases present, viz. CuSO<sub>4</sub>,
  CuSO<sub>4</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O, and vapour, the system becomes
  <i>univariant</i>; and since the temperature is constant, the pressure
  must also be constant. Continued addition of vapour will result merely in
  an increase in the amount of the hydrate, and a decrease in the amount of
  the anhydrous salt. When the latter has entirely disappeared, <i>i.e.</i>
  has passed into hydrated salt, the system again becomes <i>bivariant</i>,
  and passes along the line EF; the pressure gradually increases,
  therefore, until at F the hydrate 3H<sub>2</sub>O is formed, and the
  system again becomes univariant; the three phases present are
  CuSO<sub>4</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O, CuSO<sub>4</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O,
  vapour. The pressure will remain constant, therefore, until the hydrate
  1H<sub>2</sub>O has disappeared, when it will again increase till G is
  reached; here the hydrate 5H<sub>2</sub>O is formed, and the pressure
  once more remains constant until the complete disappearance of the
  hydrate 3H<sub>2</sub>O has taken place.</p>

  <p>Conversely, on dehydrating CuSO<sub>4</sub>,5H<sub>2</sub>O at
  constant temperature, we should find that the pressure would maintain the
  value corresponding to the dissociation pressure of the system
  CuSO<sub>4</sub>,5H<sub>2</sub>O&mdash;CuSO<sub>4</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O&mdash;vapour,
  until all the hydrate 5H<sub>2</sub>O had disappeared; further removal of
  water would then cause the pressure to fall <i>abruptly</i> to the
  pressure of the system
  CuSO<sub>4</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O&mdash;CuSO<sub>4</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O&mdash;vapour,
  at which value it would again remain constant until the tri-hydrate had
  passed into the monohydrate, when a further sudden diminution of the
  pressure would occur. This behaviour is represented diagrammatically in
  Fig. 20, the values of the pressure being those at 50°.</p>

  <p><b>Efflorescence.</b>&mdash;From Fig. 19 we are enabled to predict the
  conditions under which a given hydrated salt will effloresce when exposed
  to the air. We have just learned that copper <!-- Page 87 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page87"></a>{87}</span>sulphate pentahydrate,
  for example, will not be formed unless the pressure of the aqueous vapour
  reaches a certain value; and that conversely, if the vapour pressure
  falls below the dissociation pressure of the pentahydrate, this salt will
  undergo dehydration. From this, then, it is evident that a crystalline
  salt hydrate will effloresce when exposed to the air, if the partial
  pressure of the water vapour in the air is lower than the dissociation
  pressure of the hydrate. At the ordinary temperature the dissociation
  pressure of copper sulphate is less than the pressure of water vapour in
  the air, and therefore copper sulphate does not effloresce. In the case
  of sodium sulphate decahydrate, however, the dissociation pressure is
  greater than the normal vapour pressure in a room, and this salt
  therefore effloresces.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:24%;">

    <span class="sc">Fig. 20.</span>
  </div>

  <p><b>Indefiniteness of the Vapour Pressure of a
  Hydrate.</b>&mdash;Reference has already been made (p.&nbsp;<a
  href="#page84">84</a>), in the case of the ammonia compounds of the metal
  chlorides, to the importance of the solid product of dissociation for the
  definition of the dissociation pressure. Similarly also in the case of a
  hydrated salt. A salt hydrate in contact with vapour constitutes only a
  bivariant system, and can exist therefore at different values of
  temperature and pressure of vapour, as is seen from the diagram, Fig. 19.
  Anhydrous copper sulphate can exist in contact with water vapour at all
  values of temperature and pressure lying in the field below the curve OC;
  and the hydrate CuSO<sub>4</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O can exist in contact with
  vapour at all values of temperature and pressure in the field BOC.
  Similarly, each of the other hydrates can exist in contact with vapour at
  different values of temperature and pressure.</p>

  <p>From the Phase Rule, however, we learn that, in order that at a given
  temperature the pressure of a two-component system <!-- Page 88 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page88"></a>{88}</span>may be constant, there
  must be three phases present. Strictly, therefore, we can speak only of
  the vapour pressure of a <i>system</i>; and since, in the cases under
  discussion, the hydrates dissociate into a solid and a vapour, any
  statement as to the vapour pressure of a hydrate has a definite meaning
  <i>only when the second solid phase produced by the dissociation is
  given</i>. The everyday custom of speaking of the vapour pressure of a
  hydrated salt acquires a meaning only through the assumption, tacitly
  made, that the second solid phase, or the solid produced by the
  dehydration of the hydrate, is the <i>next lower</i> hydrate, where more
  hydrates than one exist. That a hydrate always dissociates in such a way
  that the next lower hydrate is formed is, however, by no means certain;
  indeed, cases have been met with where apparently the anhydrous salt, and
  not the lower hydrate (the existence of which was possible), was produced
  by the dissociation of the higher hydrate.<a name="NtA156"
  href="#Nt156"><sup>[156]</sup></a></p>

  <p>That a salt hydrate can exhibit different vapour pressures according
  to the solid product of dissociation, can not only be proved
  theoretically, but it has also been shown experimentally to be a fact.
  Thus CaCl<sub>2</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O can dissociate into water vapour
  and either of two lower hydrates, each containing four molecules of water
  of crystallization, and designated respectively as
  CaCl<sub>2</sub>,4H<sub>2</sub>O<span class="grk">&alpha;</span>, and
  CaCl<sub>2</sub>,4H<sub>2</sub>O<span class="grk">&beta;</span>.
  Roozeboom<a name="NtA157" href="#Nt157"><sup>[157]</sup></a> has shown
  that the vapour pressure which is obtained differs according to which of
  these two hydrates is formed, as can be seen from the following
  figures:&mdash;</p>

  <p>By reason of the non-recognition of the importance of the solid
  dissociation product for the definition of the dissociation pressure of a
  salt hydrate, many of the older determinations lose much of their
  value.</p>

  <p><b>Suspended Transformation.</b>&mdash;Just as in systems of one
  component we found that a new phase was not necessarily formed when the
  conditions for its existence were established, so also we find that even
  when the vapour pressure is lowered below the dissociation pressure of a
  system, dissociation does not necessarily occur. This is well known in
  the case of Glauber's salt, first observed by Faraday. Undamaged crystals
  of Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,10H<sub>2</sub>O could be kept unchanged
  in the open air, although the vapour pressure of the system
  Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,10H<sub>2</sub>O&mdash;Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>&mdash;vapour
  is greater than the ordinary pressure of aqueous vapour in the air. That
  is to say, the possibility of the formation of the new phase
  Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> was given; nevertheless this new phase did
  not appear, and the system therefore became metastable, or unstable with
  respect to the anhydrous salt. When, however, a trace of the new
  phase&mdash;the anhydrous salt&mdash;was brought in contact with the
  hydrate, transformation occurred; the hydrate effloresced.</p>

  <p>The possibility of suspended transformation or the non-formation of
  the new phases must also be granted in the case where the vapour pressure
  is raised above that corresponding to the system hydrate&mdash;anhydrous
  salt (or lower hydrate)&mdash;vapour; in this case the formation of the
  higher hydrate becomes a possibility, but not a certainty. Although there
  is no example of this known in the case of hydrated salts, the suspension
  of the transformation has been observed in the case of the compounds of
  ammonia with the metal chlorides (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page82">82</a>).
  Horstmann,<a name="NtA158" href="#Nt158"><sup>[158]</sup></a> for
  example, found that the pressure of ammonia in contact with
  2AgCl,3NH<sub>3</sub> could be raised to a value higher than the
  dissociation pressure of AgCl,3NH<sub>3</sub> without this compound being
  formed. We see, therefore, that even when the existence of the higher
  compound in contact with the lower became possible, the higher compound
  was not immediately formed.</p>

  <p><b>Range of Existence of Hydrates.</b>&mdash;In Fig. 19 the vapour
  <!-- Page 90 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page90"></a>{90}</span>pressure curves of the different hydrates of
  copper sulphate are represented as maintaining their relative positions
  throughout the whole range of temperatures. But this is not necessarily
  the case. It is possible that at some temperature the vapour pressure
  curve of a lower hydrate may cut that of a higher hydrate. At
  temperatures above the point of intersection, the lower hydrate would
  have a higher vapour pressure than the higher hydrate, and would
  therefore be metastable with respect to the latter. The range of stable
  existence of the lower hydrate would therefore end at the point of
  intersection. This appears to be the case with the two hydrates of sodium
  sulphate, to which reference will be made later.<a name="NtA159"
  href="#Nt159"><sup>[159]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Constancy of Vapour Pressure and the Formation of
  Compounds.</b>&mdash;We have seen in the case of the salt hydrates that
  the continued addition of the vapour phase to the system caused an
  increase in the pressure until at a definite value of the pressure a
  hydrate is formed; the pressure then becomes constant, and remains so,
  until one of the solid phases has disappeared. Conversely, on withdrawing
  the vapour phase, the pressure remained constant so long as any of the
  dissociating compound was present, independently of the degree of the
  decomposition (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page86">86</a>). This behaviour, now, has
  been employed for the purpose of determining whether or not definite
  chemical compounds are formed. Should compounds be formed between the
  vapour phase and the solid, then, on continued addition or withdrawal of
  the vapour phase, it will be found that the vapour pressure remains
  constant for a certain time, and will then suddenly assume a new value,
  at which it will again remain constant. By this method, Ramsay<a
  name="NtA160" href="#Nt160"><sup>[160]</sup></a> found that no definite
  hydrates were formed in the case of ferric and aluminium oxides, but that
  two are formed in the case of lead oxide, viz. 2PbO,H<sub>2</sub>O and
  3PbO,H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>

  <p>The method has also been applied to the investigation of the so-called
  palladium hydride,<a name="NtA161" href="#Nt161"><sup>[161]</sup></a> and
  the results obtained appear to show that no compound is formed. Reference
  will, however, be made to this case later (Chap. X.).</p>

<p><!-- Page 91 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page91"></a>{91}</span></p>

  <p><b>Measurement of the Vapour Pressure of Hydrates.</b>&mdash;For the
  purpose of measuring the small pressures exerted by the vapour of salt
  hydrates, use is very generally made of a differential manometer called
  the <i>Bremer-Frowein tensimeter</i>.<a name="NtA162"
  href="#Nt162"><sup>[162]</sup></a></p>

  <p>This apparatus has the form shown in Fig. 21. It consists of a
  <b>U</b>-tube, the limbs of which are bent close together, and placed in
  front of a millimetre scale. The bend of the tube is filled with oil or
  other suitable liquid, <i>e.g.</i> bromonaphthalene. If it is desired to
  measure the dissociation pressure of, say, a salt hydrate, concentrated
  sulphuric acid is placed in the flask <i>e</i>, and a quantity of the
  hydrate, well dried and powdered,<a name="NtA163"
  href="#Nt163"><sup>[163]</sup></a> in the bulb <i>d</i>. The necks of the
  bulbs <i>d</i> and <i>e</i> are then sealed off. Since, as we have
  learned, suspended transformation may occur, it is advisable to first
  partially dehydrate the salt, in order to ensure the presence of the
  second solid product of dissociation; the value of the dissociation
  pressure being independent of the degree of dissociation of the hydrate
  (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page86">86</a>). The small bulbs <i>d</i> and <i>e</i>
  having been filled, the apparatus is placed on its side, so as to allow
  the liquid to run from the bend of the tube into the bulbs <i>a</i> and
  <i>b</i>; it is then exhausted through <i>f</i> by means of a mercury
  pump, and sealed off. The apparatus is now placed in a perpendicular
  position in a thermostat, and kept at constant temperature until
  equilibrium is established. Since the vapour pressure on the side
  containing the sulphuric acid may be regarded as zero, the difference in
  level of the two surfaces of liquid in the <b>U</b>-tube gives directly
  the dissociation pressure of the hydrate in terms of the particular
  liquid employed; if the density of the latter is known, the pressure can
  then be calculated to cm. of mercury.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>

<p class="cenhead">SOLUTIONS</p>

  <p><b>Definition.</b>&mdash;In all the cases which have been considered
  in the preceding pages, the different phases&mdash;with the exception of
  the vapour phase&mdash;consisted of a single substance of definite
  composition, or were definite chemical individuals.<a name="NtA164"
  href="#Nt164"><sup>[164]</sup></a> But this invariability of the
  composition is by no means imposed by the Phase Rule; on the contrary, we
  shall find in the examples which we now proceed to study, that the
  participation of phases of variable composition in the equilibrium of a
  system is in no way excluded. To such phases of variable composition
  there is applied the term <i>solution</i>. A solution, therefore, is to
  be defined as <i>a homogeneous mixture, the composition of which can
  undergo continuous variation within certain limits</i>; the limits,
  namely, of its existence.<a name="NtA165"
  href="#Nt165"><sup>[165]</sup></a></p>

  <p>From this definition we see that the term solution is not restricted
  to any particular physical state of substances, but includes within its
  range not only the liquid, but also the gaseous and solid states. We may
  therefore have solutions of gases in liquids, and of gases in solids; of
  liquids in liquids or in solids; of solids in liquids, or of solids in
  solids. Solutions of gases in gases are, of course, also possible; since,
  however, gas solutions never give rise to more than one phase, their <!--
  Page 93 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page93"></a>{93}</span>treatment does not come within the scope of
  the Phase Rule, which deals with heterogeneous equilibria.</p>

  <p>It should also be emphasized that the definition of solution given
  above, neither creates nor recognizes any distinction between solvent and
  dissolved substance (solute); and, indeed, a too persistent use of these
  terms and the attempt to permanently label the one or other of two
  components as the solvent or the solute, can only obscure the true
  relationships and aggravate the difficulty of their interpretation. In
  all cases it should be remembered that we are dealing with equilibria
  between two components (we confine our attention in the first instance to
  such), the solution being constituted of these components in variable and
  varying amounts. The change from the case where the one component is in
  great excess (ordinarily called the solvent) to that in which the other
  component predominates, may be quite gradual, so that it is difficult or
  impossible to say at what point the one component ceases to be the
  solvent and becomes the solute. The adoption of this standpoint need not,
  however, preclude one from employing the conventional terms solvent and
  solute in ordinary language, especially when reference is made only to
  some particular condition of equilibrium of the system, when the
  concentration of the two components in the solution is widely
  different.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Solutions of Gases in Liquids.</span></p>

  <p>As the first class of solutions to which we shall turn our attention,
  there may be chosen the solutions of gases in liquids, or the equilibria
  between a liquid and a gas. These equilibria really constitute a part of
  the equilibria to be studied more fully in Chapter VIII.; but since the
  two-phase systems formed by the solutions of gases in liquids are among
  the best-known of the two-component systems, a short section may be here
  allotted to their treatment.</p>

  <p>When a gas is passed into a liquid, absorption takes place to a
  greater or less extent, and a point is at length reached when the liquid
  absorbs no more of the gas; a condition of equilibrium is attained, and
  the liquid is said to be saturated <!-- Page 94 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page94"></a>{94}</span>with the gas. In the
  light of the Phase Rule, now, such a system is bivariant (two components
  in two phases); and two of the variable factors, pressure, temperature,
  and concentration of the components, must therefore be chosen in order
  that the condition of the system may be defined. If the concentration and
  the temperature are fixed, then the pressure is also defined; or under
  given conditions of temperature and pressure, the concentration of the
  gas in the solution must have a definite value. If, however, the
  temperature alone is fixed, the concentration and the pressure can alter;
  a fact so well known that it does not require to be further insisted
  on.</p>

  <p>As to the way in which the solubility of a gas in a liquid varies with
  the pressure, the Phase Rule of course does not state; but guidance on
  this point is again yielded by the theorem of van't Hoff and Le
  Chatelier. Since the absorption of a gas is in all cases accompanied by a
  diminution of the total volume, this process must take place with
  increase of pressure. This, indeed, is stated in a quantitative manner in
  the law of Henry, according to which the amount of a gas absorbed is
  proportional to the pressure. But this law must be modified in the case
  of gases which are very readily absorbed; the <i>direction of change</i>
  of concentration with the pressure will, however, still be in accordance
  with the theorem of Le Chatelier.</p>

  <p>If, on the other hand, the pressure is fixed, then the concentration
  will vary with the temperature; and since the absorption of gases is in
  all cases accompanied by the evolution of heat, the solubility is found,
  in accordance with the theorem of Le Chatelier, to diminish with rise of
  temperature.</p>

  <p>In considering the changes of pressure accompanying changes of
  concentration and temperature, a distinction must be drawn between the
  total pressure and the partial pressure of the dissolved gas, in cases
  where the solvent is volatile. In these cases, the law of Henry applies
  not to the total pressure of the vapour, but only to the partial pressure
  of the dissolved gas. <!-- Page 95 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page95"></a>{95}</span></p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Solutions of Liquids in Liquids.</span></p>

  <p>When mercury and water are brought together, the two liquids remain
  side by side without mixing. Strictly speaking, mercury undoubtedly
  dissolves to a certain extent in the water, and water no doubt dissolves,
  although to a less extent, in the mercury; the amount of substance
  passing into solution is, however, so minute, that it may, for all
  practical purposes, be left out of account, so long as the temperature
  does not rise much above the ordinary.<a name="NtA166"
  href="#Nt166"><sup>[166]</sup></a> On the other hand, if alcohol and
  water be brought together, complete miscibility takes place, and one
  homogeneous solution is obtained. Whether water be added in increasing
  quantities to pure alcohol, or pure alcohol be added in increasing amount
  to water, at no point, at no degree of concentration, is a system
  obtained containing more than one liquid phase. At the ordinary
  temperature, water and alcohol can form only two phases, liquid and
  vapour. If, however, water be added to ether, or if ether be added to
  water, solution will not occur to an indefinite extent; but a point will
  be reached when the water or the ether will no longer dissolve more of
  the other component, and a further addition of water on the one hand, or
  ether on the other, will cause the formation of two liquid layers, one
  containing excess of water, the other excess of ether. We shall,
  therefore, expect to find all grades of miscibility, from almost perfect
  immiscibility to perfect miscibility, or miscibility in all proportions.
  In cases of perfect immiscibility, the components do not affect one
  another, and the system therefore remains unchanged. Such cases do not
  call for treatment here. We have to concern ourselves here only with the
  second and third cases, viz. with cases of complete and of partial
  miscibility. There is no essential difference between the two classes,
  for, as we shall see, <!-- Page 96 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page96"></a>{96}</span>the one passes into the other with change of
  temperature. The formal separation into two groups is based on the
  miscibility relations at ordinary temperatures.</p>

  <p><b>Partial or Limited Miscibility.</b>&mdash;In accordance with the
  Phase Rule, a pure liquid in contact with its vapour constitutes a
  univariant system. If, however, a small quantity of a second substance is
  added, which is capable of dissolving in the first, a bivariant system
  will be obtained; for there are now two components and, as before, only
  two phases&mdash;the homogeneous liquid solution and the vapour. At
  constant temperature, therefore, both the composition of the solution and
  the pressure of the vapour can undergo change; or, if the composition of
  the solution remains unchanged, the pressure and the temperature can
  alter. If the second (liquid) component is added in increasing amount,
  the liquid will at first remain homogeneous, and its composition and
  pressure will undergo a continuous change; when, however, the
  concentration has reached a definite value, solution no longer takes
  place; two liquid phases are produced. Since there are now three phases
  present, two liquids and vapour, the system is univariant; at a given
  temperature, therefore, the concentration of the components in the two
  liquid phases, as well as the vapour pressure, must have definite values.
  Addition of one of the components, therefore, cannot alter the
  concentrations or the pressure, but can only cause a change in the
  relative amounts of the phases.</p>

  <p>The two liquid phases can be regarded, the one as a solution of the
  component I. in component II., the other as a solution of component II.
  in component I. If the pressure is maintained constant, then to each
  temperature there will correspond a definite concentration of the
  components in the two liquid phases; and addition of excess of one will
  merely alter the relative amounts of the two solutions. As the
  temperature changes, the composition of the two solutions will change,
  and there will therefore be obtained two solubility curves, one showing
  the solubility of component I. in component II., the other showing the
  solubility of component II. in component I. Since heat may be either
  evolved or absorbed when one liquid dissolves in another, the solubility
  may diminish or increase <!-- Page 97 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page97"></a>{97}</span>with rise of temperature. The two solutions
  which at a given temperature correspond to one another are known as
  <i>conjugate solutions</i>.</p>

  <p>The solubility relations of partially miscible liquids have been
  studied by Guthrie,<a name="NtA167" href="#Nt167"><sup>[167]</sup></a>
  and more especially by Alexejeff<a name="NtA168"
  href="#Nt168"><sup>[168]</sup></a> and by Rothmund.<a name="NtA169"
  href="#Nt169"><sup>[169]</sup></a> A considerable variety of curves have
  been obtained, and we shall therefore discuss only a few of the different
  cases which may be taken as typical of the rest.</p>

  <p><b>Phenol and Water.</b>&mdash;When phenol is added to water at the
  ordinary temperature, solution takes place, and a homogeneous liquid is
  produced. When, however, the concentration of the phenol in the solution
  has risen to about 8 per cent., phenol ceases to be dissolved; and a
  further addition of it causes the formation of a second liquid phase,
  which consists of excess of phenol and a small quantity of water. In
  ordinary language it may be called a solution of water in phenol. If now
  the temperature is raised, this second liquid phase will disappear, and a
  further amount of phenol must be added in order to produce a separation
  of the liquid into two layers. In this way, by increasing the amount of
  phenol and noting the temperature at which the two layers disappear, the
  so-called solubility curve of phenol in water can be obtained. By noting
  the change of the solubility with the temperature in this manner, it is
  found that at all temperatures below 68.4°, the addition of more than a
  certain amount of phenol causes the formation of two layers; at
  temperatures above this, however, two layers cannot be formed, no matter
  how much phenol is added. At temperatures above 68.4°, therefore, water
  and phenol are miscible in all proportions.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, if water is added to phenol at the ordinary
  temperature, a liquid is produced which consists chiefly of phenol, and
  on increasing the amount of water beyond a certain point, two layers are
  formed. On raising the temperature these two layers disappear, and a
  homogeneous solution is again obtained. The phenomena are exactly
  analogous to those already described. Since, now, in the second <!-- Page
  98 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page98"></a>{98}</span>case the
  concentration of the phenol in the solution gradually decreases, while in
  the former case it gradually increases, a point must at length be reached
  at which the composition of the two solutions becomes the same. On mixing
  the two solutions, therefore, one homogeneous liquid will be obtained.
  But the point at which two phases become identical is called a critical
  point, so that, in accordance with this definition, the temperature at
  which the two solutions of phenol and water become identical may be
  called the <i>critical solution temperature</i>, and the concentration at
  this point may be called the <i>critical concentration</i>.</p>

  <p>From what has been said above, it will be seen that at any temperature
  below the critical solution temperature, two conjugate solutions

  together, one containing excess of water, the other excess of phenol. The

  <p>The critical solution temperature for phenol and water is 68.4°, the
  critical concentration 36.1 per cent. of phenol. At all temperatures
  above 68.4°, only homogeneous solutions of phenol and water can be
  obtained; water and phenol are then miscible in all proportions.</p>

  <p>At the critical solution point the system exists in only two
  phases&mdash;liquid and vapour. It ought, therefore, to possess two
  degrees of freedom. The restriction is, however, imposed that the
  composition of the two liquid phases, coexisting at a point infinitely
  near to the critical point, becomes the same, and this disposes of one of
  the degrees of freedom. The system is therefore univariant; and at a
  given temperature the pressure will have a definite value. Conversely, if
  the pressure is fixed (as is the case when the system is under the
  pressure of its own vapour), then the temperature will also be fixed;
  that is, the critical solution temperature has a definite value depending
  only on the substances. If the vapour phase is omitted, the temperature
  will alter with the pressure; in this case, however, as in the case of
  other condensed systems, the effect of pressure is slight.</p>

  <p>From Fig. 22 it is easy to predict the effect of bringing together
  water and phenol in any given quantities at any temperature. Start with a
  solution of phenol and water having the composition represented by the
  point <i>x</i>. If to this solution phenol is added at constant
  temperature, it will dissolve, and the composition of the solution will
  gradually change, as shown by the dotted line <i>xy</i>. When, however,
  the concentration has reached the value represented by the point
  <i>y</i>, two liquid layers will be formed, the one solution having the
  composition represented by <i>y</i>, the other that represented by
  <i>y&prime;</i>. The system is now univariant, and on further addition of
  phenol, the composition of the two liquid phases will remain unchanged,
  but their relative amounts will alter. The phase richer in phenol will
  increase in amount; that richer in water will decrease, and ultimately
  disappear, and there will remain the solution <i>y&prime;</i>. Continued
  addition of phenol will then lead to the point <i>x&prime;</i>, there
  being now only one liquid phase present.</p>

  <p>Since the critical solution point represents the highest temperature
  at which two liquid phases consisting of phenol and <!-- Page 100
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page100"></a>{100}</span>water can
  exist together, these two substances can be brought together in any
  amount whatever at temperatures higher than 68.4°, without the formation
  of two layers. It will therefore be possible to pass from a system
  represented by <i>x</i> to one represented by <i>x&prime;</i>, without at
  any time two liquid phases appearing. Starting with <i>x</i>, the
  temperature is first raised above the critical solution temperature;
  phenol is then added until the concentration reaches the point
  <i>x</i><sub>2</sub>. On allowing the temperature to fall, the system
  will then pass into the condition represented by <i>x&prime;</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Triethylamine and Water.</b>&mdash;Although in most of the cases
  studied the solubility of one liquid in another increases with rise of
  temperature, this is not so in all cases. Thus, at temperatures below
  18°, triethylamine and water mix together in all proportions; but, on
  raising the temperature, the homogeneous solution becomes turbid and
  separates into two layers. In this case, therefore, the critical solution
  temperature is found in the direction of lower temperature, not in the
  direction of higher.<a name="NtA172" href="#Nt172"><sup>[172]</sup></a>

  <p><b>General Form of Concentration-Temperature Curve.</b>&mdash;From the
  preceding figures it will be seen that the general <!-- Page 102 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page102"></a>{102}</span>form of the solubility
  curve is somewhat parabolic in shape; in the case of triethylamine and
  water, the closed end of the curve is very flat. Since for all liquids
  there is a point (critical point) at which the liquid and gaseous states
  become identical, and since all gases are miscible in all proportions, it
  follows that there must be some temperature at which the liquids become
  perfectly miscible. In the case of triethylamine and water, which has
  just been considered, there must therefore be an upper critical solution
  temperature, so that the complete solubility relations would be
  represented by a closed curve of an ellipsoidal aspect. An example of
  such a curve is furnished by nicotine and water. At temperatures below
  60° and above 210°, nicotine and water mix in all proportions.<a
  name="NtA173" href="#Nt173"><sup>[173]</sup></a> Although it is possible
  that this is the general form of the curve for all pairs of liquids,
  there are as yet insufficient data to prove it.</p>

  <p>With regard to the closed end of the curve it may be said that it is
  continuous; the critical solution point is not the intersection of two
  curves, for such a break in the continuity of the curve could occur only
  if there were some discontinuity in one of the phases. No such
  discontinuity exists. The curve is, therefore, not to be considered as
  two solubility curves cutting at a point; it is a curve of equilibrium
  between two components, and so long as the phases undergo continuous
  change, the curve representing the equilibrium must also be continuous.
  As has already been emphasized, a distinction between solvent and solute
  is merely conventional (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page93">93</a>).</p>

  <p><b>Pressure-Concentration Diagram.</b>&mdash;In considering the
  pressure-concentration diagram of a system of two liquid components, a
  distinction must be drawn between the total pressure of the system and
  the partial pressures of the components. On studying the total pressure
  of a system, it is found that two cases can be obtained.<a name="NtA174"
  href="#Nt174"><sup>[174]</sup></a></p>

  <p>So long as there is only one liquid phase, the system is bivariant.
  The pressure therefore can change with the concentration and the
  temperature. If the temperature is maintained <!-- Page 103 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page103"></a>{103}</span>constant, the pressure
  will vary only with the concentration, and this variation can therefore
  be represented by a curve. If, however, two liquid phases are formed, the
  system becomes univariant: and if one of the variables, say the
  temperature, is arbitrarily fixed, the system no longer possesses any
  degree of freedom. <i>When two liquid phases are formed, therefore, the
  concentrations and the vapour pressure have definite values, which are
  maintained so long as the two liquid phases are present</i>; the
  temperature being supposed constant.</p>

  <p>In Fig. 25 is given a diagrammatic representation of the two kinds of
  pressure-concentration curves which have so far been obtained. In the one
  case, the vapour pressure of the invariant system (at constant
  temperature) lies higher than the vapour pressure of either of the pure
  components; a phenomenon which is very generally found in the case of
  partially miscible liquids, <i>e.g.</i> ether and water.<a name="NtA175"
  href="#Nt175"><sup>[175]</sup></a> Accordingly, by the addition of water
  to ether, or of ether to water, there is an increase in the <i>total</i>
  vapour pressure of the system.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:25%;">
      <a href="images/fig025.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig025.png"
      alt="Fig. 25" title="Fig. 25" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 25.</span>
  </div>

  <p>With regard to the second type, the vapour pressure of the systems
  with two liquid phases lies between that of the two single components. An
  example of this is found in sulphur dioxide and water.<a name="NtA176"
  href="#Nt176"><sup>[176]</sup></a> On adding sulphur dioxide to water
  there is an increase of the total vapour pressure; but on adding water to
  liquid sulphur dioxide, the total vapour pressure is diminished.</p>

  <p>The case that the vapour pressure of the system with two <!-- Page 104
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page104"></a>{104}</span>liquid phases
  is <i>less</i> than that of each of the components is not possible.</p>

  <p>With regard to the <i>partial pressure</i> of the components, the
  behaviour is more uniform. The partial pressure of one component is in
  all cases lowered by the addition of the other component, the diminution
  being approximately proportional to the amount added. If two liquid
  phases are present, the partial pressure of the components, as well as
  the total pressure, is constant, and is the same for both phases. That is
  to say, in the case of the two liquids, saturated solution of water in
  ether, and of ether in water, the partial pressure of the ether in the
  vapour in contact with the one solution is the same as that in the vapour
  over the other solution.<a name="NtA177"
  href="#Nt177"><sup>[177]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Complete Miscibility.</b>&mdash;Although the phenomena of complete
  miscibility are here treated under a separate heading, it must not be
  thought that there is any essential difference between those cases where
  the liquids exhibit limited miscibility and those in which only one
  homogeneous solution is formed. As has been already pointed out, the
  solubility relations alter with the temperature; and liquids which at one
  temperature can dissolve in one another only to a limited extent, are
  found at some other temperature to possess the property of complete
  miscibility. Conversely, we may expect that liquids which at one
  temperature, say at the ordinary temperature, are miscible in all
  proportions, will be found at some other temperature to be only partially
  miscible. Thus, for example, it was found by Guthrie that ethyl alcohol
  and carbon disulphide, which are miscible in all proportions at the
  ordinary temperature, possess only limited miscibility at temperatures
  below -14.4°.<a name="NtA178" href="#Nt178"><sup>[178]</sup></a>
  Nevertheless, it is doubtful if the critical solution temperature is in
  all cases experimentally realizable.</p>

  <p><b>Pressure-Concentration Diagram.</b>&mdash;Since, in the cases of
  complete miscibility of two liquid components, there are never more than
  two phases present, the system must always be bivariant; and two of the
  variables pressure, temperature or concentration of the components, must
  be arbitrarily chosen <!-- Page 105 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page105"></a>{105}</span>before the system becomes defined. For
  this reason the Phase Rule affords only a slight guidance in the study of
  such equilibria; and we shall therefore not enter in detail into the
  behaviour of these homogeneous mixtures. All that the Phase Rule can tell
  us in connection with these solutions, is that at constant temperature
  the vapour pressure of the solution varies with the composition of the
  liquid phase; and if the composition of the liquid phase remains
  unchanged, the pressure also must remain unchanged. This constancy of
  composition is exhibited not only by pure liquids, but also by liquid
  solutions in all cases where the vapour pressure of the solution reaches
  a maximum or minimum value. This is the case, for example, with mixtures
  of constant boiling point.<a name="NtA179"

<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>

<p class="cenhead">SOLUTIONS OF SOLIDS IN LIQUIDS, ONLY ONE OF THE
COMPONENTS BEING VOLATILE</p>

  <p><b>General.</b>&mdash;When a solid is brought into contact with a
  liquid in which it can dissolve, a certain amount of it passes into
  solution; and the process continues until the concentration reaches a
  definite value independent of the amount of solid present. A condition of
  equilibrium is established between the solid and the solution; the
  solution becomes <i>saturated</i>. Since the number of components is two,
  and the number of phases three, viz. solid, liquid solution, vapour, the
  system is univariant. If, therefore, one of the factors, pressure,
  temperature, or concentration of the components (in the solution<a
  name="NtA180" href="#Nt180"><sup>[180]</sup></a>), is arbitrarily fixed,
  the state of the system becomes perfectly defined. Thus, at any given
  temperature, the vapour pressure of the system and the concentration of
  the components have a definite value. If the temperature is altered, the
  vapour pressure and also, in general, the concentration will undergo
  change. Likewise, if the pressure varies, while the system is isolated so
  that no heat can pass between it and its surroundings, the concentration
  and the temperature must also undergo variation until they attain values
  corresponding to the particular pressure.</p>

  <p>That the temperature has an influence, sometimes a very considerable
  influence, on the amount of substance passing into solution, is
  sufficiently well known; the effect of pressure, although less apparent,
  is no less certain. If at any given temperature the volume of the vapour
  phase is diminished, <!-- Page 107 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page107"></a>{107}</span>vapour will condense to liquid, in order
  that the pressure may remain constant, and so much of the solid will pass
  into solution that the concentration may remain unchanged; for, so long
  as the three phases are present, the state of the system cannot alter.
  If, however, one of the phases, <i>e.g.</i> the vapour phase, disappears,
  the system becomes bivariant; at any given temperature, therefore, there
  may be different values of concentration and pressure.</p>

  <p>The direction in which change of concentration will occur with change
  of pressure can be predicted by means of the theorem of Le Chatelier, if
  it is known whether solution is accompanied by increase or diminution of
  the total volume. If diminution of the total volume of the system occurs
  on solution, increase of pressure will increase the solubility; in the
  reverse case, increase of pressure will diminish the solubility.</p>

  <p>This conclusion has also been verified by experiment, as is shown by
  the following figures.<a name="NtA181"

  <p>As can be seen, a large increase of the pressure brings about a no
  more than appreciable alteration of the solubility; a result which is
  due, as in the case of the alteration of the fusion point with the
  pressure, to the small change in volume accompanying solution or increase
  of pressure. For all practical purposes, therefore, the solubility as
  determined under atmospheric pressure may be taken as equal to the true
  <!-- Page 108 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page108"></a>{108}</span>solubility, that is, the solubility when
  the system is under the pressure of its own vapour.</p>

  <p><b>The Saturated Solution.</b>&mdash;From what has been said above, it
  will be seen that the condition of saturation of a solution can be
  defined only with respect to a certain solid phase; if no solid is
  present, the system is undefined, for it then consists of only two
  phases, and is therefore bivariant. Under such circumstances not only can
  there be at one given temperature solutions of different concentration,
  all containing less of one of the components than when that component is
  present in the solid form, but there can also exist solutions containing
  more of that component than corresponds to the equilibrium when the solid
  is present. In the former case the solutions are <i>unsaturated</i>, in
  the latter case they are <i>supersaturated with respect to a certain
  solid phase</i>; in themselves, the solutions are stable, and are neither
  unsaturated nor supersaturated. Further, if the solid substance can exist
  in different allotropic modifications, the particular form of the
  substance which is in equilibrium with the solution must be known, in
  order that the statement of the solubility may be definite; for each form
  has its own solubility, and, as we shall see presently, the less stable
  form has the greater solubility (cf. p.&nbsp;<a href="#page47">47</a>). In all
  determinations of the solubility, therefore, not only must the
  concentration of the components in the solution be determined, but equal
  importance should be attached to the characterisation of the solid phase
  present.</p>

  <p>In this connection, also, one other point may be emphasised. For the
  production of the equilibrium between a solid and a liquid, time is
  necessary, and this time not only varies with the state of division of
  the solid and the efficiency of the stirring, but is also dependent on
  the nature of the substance.<a name="NtA182"
  href="#Nt182"><sup>[182]</sup></a> Considerable care must therefore be
  taken that sufficient time is allowed for equilibrium to be established.
  Such care is more especially needful when changes may occur in the solid
  phase, and neglect of it has greatly diminished the value of many of the
  older determinations of solubility.</p>

  <p><b>Form of the Solubility Curve.</b>&mdash;The solubility
  curve&mdash;that <!-- Page 109 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page109"></a>{109}</span>is, the curve representing the change of
  concentration of the components in the solution with the
  temperature&mdash;differs markedly from the curve of vapour pressure
  (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page63">63</a>), in that it possesses no general form, but
  may vary in the most diverse manner. Not only may the curve have an
  almost straight and horizontal course, or slope or curve upwards at
  varying angles; but it may even slope downwards, corresponding to a
  decrease in the solubility with rise of temperature; may exhibit maxima
  or minima of solubility, or may, as in the case of some hydrated salts,
  pass through a point of maximum temperature. In the latter case the salt
  may possess two values of solubility at the same temperature. We shall
  consider these cases in the following chapter.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:25%;">
      <a href="images/fig026.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig026.png"

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 26.
  </div>

  <p>The great variety of form shown by solubility curves is at once
  apparent from Fig. 26, in which the solubility curves of various
  substances (not, however, drawn to scale) are reproduced.<a name="NtA183"
  href="#Nt183"><sup>[183]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Varied as is the form of the solubility curve, its <i>direction</i>,
  nevertheless, can be predicted by means of the theorem of van't Hoff and
  Le Chatelier; for in accordance with that theorem (p.&nbsp;<a
  href="#page57">57</a>) increase of solubility with the temperature must
  occur in those cases where the process of solution is accompanied by an
  <i>absorption</i> of heat; and a decrease in the solubility with rise of
  temperature will be found in cases where solution occurs with
  <i>evolution</i> of heat. Where there is no heat effect accompanying
  solution, <!-- Page 110 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page110"></a>{110}</span>change of temperature will be without
  influence on the solubility; and if the sign of the heat of solution
  changes, the direction of the solubility curve must also change,
  <i>i.e.</i> must show a maximum or minimum point. This has in all cases
  been verified by experiment.<a name="NtA184"
  href="#Nt184"><sup>[184]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In applying the theorem of Le Chatelier to the course of the
  solubility curve, it should be noted that by heat of solution there is
  meant, not the heat effect produced on dissolving the salt in a large
  amount of solvent (which is the usual signification of the expression),
  but the heat which is absorbed or evolved when the salt is dissolved in
  the almost saturated solution (the so-called last heat of solution). Not
  only does the heat effect in the two cases have a different value, but it
  may even have a different sign. A striking example of this is afforded by
  cupric chloride, as the following figures show:<a name="NtA185"
  href="#Nt185"><sup>[185]</sup></a>&mdash;</p>

</table>

  <p>In the above table the positive sign indicates evolution of heat, the
  negative sign, absorption of heat; and the values of the heat effect are
  expressed in centuple calories. Judging from the heat effect produced on
  dissolving cupric chloride in a large bulk of water, we should predict
  that the solubility of that salt would diminish with rise of temperature;
  as a matter of fact, it increases. This is in accordance with the fact
  that <!-- Page 111 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page111"></a>{111}</span>the last heat of solution is
  <i>negative</i> (as expressed above), <i>i.e.</i> solution of the salt in
  the almost saturated solution is accompanied by absorption of heat. We
  are led to expect this from the fact that the heat of solution changes
  sign from positive to negative as the concentration increases; experiment
  also showed it to be the case.</p>

  <p>Despite its many forms, it should be particularly noted that the
  solubility curve of any substance is <i>continuous</i>, so long as the
  solid phase, or solid substance in contact with the solution, remains
  unchanged. If any "break" or discontinuous change in the direction of the
  curve occurs, it is a sign that the <i>solid phase has undergone
  alteration</i>. Conversely, if it is known that a change takes place in
  the solid phase, a break in the solubility curve can be predicted. We
  shall presently meet with examples of this.<a name="NtA186"
  href="#Nt186"><sup>[186]</sup></a></p>

<p class="cenhead">A.&mdash;<span class="sc">Anhydrous Salt and Water</span>.</p>

  <p><b>The Solubility Curve.</b>&mdash;In studying the equilibria in those
  systems of two components in which the liquid phase is a solution or
  phase of varying composition, we shall in the present chapter limit the
  discussion to those cases where no compounds are formed, but where the
  components crystallise out in the pure state. Since some of the
  best-known examples of such systems are yielded by the solutions of
  anhydrous salts in water, we shall first of all briefly consider some of
  the results which have been obtained with them.</p>

  <p>For the most part the solubility curves have been studied only at
  temperatures lying between 0° and 100°, the solid phase in contact with
  the solution being the anhydrous salt. For the representation of these
  equilibria, the concentration-temperature <!-- Page 112 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page112"></a>{112}</span>diagram is employed,
  the concentration being expressed as the number of grams of the salt
  dissolved in 100 grams of water, or as the number of gram-molecules of
  salt in 100 gram-molecules of water. The curves thus obtained exhibit the
  different forms to which reference has already been made. So long as the
  salt remains unchanged the curve will be continuous, but if the salt
  alters its form, then the solubility curve will show a break.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:23%;">

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 27.
  </div>

  <p>Now, we have already seen in Chapter III. that certain substances are
  capable of existing in various crystalline forms, and these forms are so
  related to one another that at a given temperature the relative stability
  of each pair of polymorphic forms undergoes change. Since each
  crystalline variety of a substance must have its own solubility, there
  must be a break in the solubility curve at the temperature of transition
  of the two enantiotropic forms. At this point the two solubility curves
  must cut, for since the two forms are in equilibrium with respect to
  their vapour, they must also be in equilibrium with respect to their
  solutions. From the table on p.&nbsp;<a href="#page63">63</a> it is seen that
  potassium nitrate, ammonium nitrate, silver nitrate, thallium nitrate,
  thallium picrate, are capable of existing in two or more different
  enantiotropic crystalline forms, the range of stability of these forms
  being limited by definite temperatures (transition temperature). Since
  the transition point is not altered by a solvent (provided the latter is
  not absorbed by the solid phase), we should find on studying the
  solubility of these substances in water that the solubility curve would
  exhibit a change in direction at the temperature of transition. As a
  matter of fact this has been verified, more especially in the case of
  ammonium nitrate<a name="NtA187" href="#Nt187"><sup>[187]</sup></a> <!--
  Page 113 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page113"></a>{113}</span>and
  thallium picrate.<a name="NtA188" href="#Nt188"><sup>[188]</sup></a> The
  following table contains the values of the solubility of ammonium nitrate
  obtained by Müller and Kaufmann, the solubility being expressed in
  gram-molecules NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> in 100 gram-molecules of
  water. In Fig. 27 these results are represented graphically. The
  equilibrium point was approached both from the side of unsaturation and
  of supersaturation, and the condition of equilibrium was controlled by
  determinations of the density of the solution.</p>

  <p>From the graphic representation of the solubility given in Fig. 27,
  there is seen to be a distinct change in the direction of the curve at a
  temperature of 32°; and this break in the curve corresponds to the
  transition of the <span class="grk">&beta;</span>-rhombic into the <span
  class="grk">&alpha;</span>-rhombic form of ammonium nitrate (p.&nbsp;<a
  href="#page63">63</a>).</p>

  <p><b>Suspended Transformation and Supersaturation.</b>&mdash;As has
  already been learned, the transformation of the one crystalline form into
  the other does not necessarily take place immediately the transition
  point has been passed; and it has therefore been found possible in a
  number of cases to follow the solubility curve of a given crystalline
  form beyond the point at which it ceases to be the most stable
  modification. Now, it will be readily seen from Fig. 27 that if the two
  solubility curves be prolonged beyond the point of intersection, the
  solubility of the less stable form is greater than that of the more
  stable. A solution, therefore, which is saturated with respect to the
  less stable form, <i>i.e.</i> which is in equilibrium with that form, is
  <i>supersaturated with respect to the more stable modification</i>. If,
  <!-- Page 114 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page114"></a>{114}</span>therefore, a small quantity of the more
  stable form is introduced into the solution, the latter must deposit such
  an amount of the more stable form that the concentration of the solution
  corresponds to the solubility of the stable form at the particular
  temperature. Since, however, the solution is now <i>unsaturated</i> with
  respect to the less stable variety, the latter, if present, must pass
  into solution; and the two processes, deposition of the stable and
  solution of the metastable form, must go on until the latter form has
  entirely disappeared and a saturated solution of the stable form is
  obtained. There will thus be a conversion, through the medium of the
  solvent, of the less stable into the more stable modification. This
  behaviour is of practical importance in the determination of transition
  points (<i>v.</i> Appendix).</p>

  <p>From the above discussion it will be seen how important is the
  statement of the solid phase for the definition of saturation and
  supersaturation.<a name="NtA189" href="#Nt189"><sup>[189]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In this figure the composition of the solution is expressed in parts
  of silver nitrate in 100 parts by weight of the solution, so that 100 per
  cent. represents pure silver nitrate. As can be seen, the solubility
  increases with the temperature. At a temperature of about 160° there
  should be a break in the curve due to change of crystalline form (p.&nbsp;<a
  href="#page63">63</a>). Such a change in the direction of the solubility
  curve, however, does not in any way alter the essential nature of the
  relationships discussed here, and may for the present be left out of
  account. On following the solubility curve of silver nitrate to higher
  temperatures, therefore, the concentration of silver nitrate in the
  solution gradually increases, until at last, at a temperature of 208°,<a
  name="NtA192" href="#Nt192"><sup>[192]</sup></a> the melting point of
  pure silver nitrate is reached, and the concentration of the water has
  become zero. The curve throughout its whole extent represents the
  equilibrium between silver nitrate, solution, and vapour. Conversely,
  starting with pure silver nitrate in contact with the fused salt,
  addition of water will lower the melting point, <i>i.e.</i> will lower
  the temperature at which the solid salt can exist in contact with the
  liquid; <!-- Page 116 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page116"></a>{116}</span>and the depression will be all the greater
  the larger the amount of water added. As the concentration of the water
  in the liquid phase is increased, therefore, the system will pass back
  along the curve from higher to lower temperatures, and from greater to
  smaller concentrations of silver nitrate in the liquid phase. The curve
  in Fig. 28 may, therefore, be regarded either as the solubility curve of
  silver nitrate in water, or as the freezing point curve for silver
  nitrate in contact with a solution consisting of that salt and water.</p>

  <p>As the temperature of the saturated solution falls, silver nitrate is
  deposited, and on lowering the temperature sufficiently a point will at
  last be reached at which ice also begins to separate out. Since there are
  now four phases co-existing, viz. silver nitrate, ice, solution, vapour,
  the system is invariant, and the point is a <i>quadruple point</i>. This
  quadruple point, therefore, forms the lower limit of the solubility curve
  of silver nitrate. Below this point the solution becomes metastable.</p>

  <p><b>Ice as Solid Phase.</b>&mdash;Ice melts or is in equilibrium with
  water at a temperature of 0°. The melting point, will, however, be
  lowered by the solution of silver nitrate in the water; and the greater
  the concentration of the salt in the solution the greater will be the
  depression of the temperature of equilibrium. On continuing the addition
  of silver nitrate, a point will at length be reached at which the salt is
  no longer dissolved, but remains in the solid form along with the ice. We
  again obtain, therefore, the invariant system
  ice&mdash;salt&mdash;solution&mdash;vapour. The temperature at which this
  invariant system can exist has been found by Middelberg<a name="NtA193"
  href="#Nt193"><sup>[193]</sup></a> to be -7.3°, the solution at this
  point containing 47.1 per cent. of silver nitrate.</p>

  <p>The same general behaviour will be found in the case of all other
  systems of two components belonging to this class; that is, in the case
  of systems from which the components crystallise out in the pure state,
  and in which the fused components are miscible in all proportions. In all
  such cases, therefore, the solubility curves (curves of equilibrium) can
  be represented diagrammatically as in Fig. 29. In this figure OA
  represents the solubility curve of the salt, and OB the freezing <!--
  Page 117 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page117"></a>{117}</span>point
  curve of ice. O is the quadruple point at which the invariant system
  exists, and may be regarded as the point of intersection of the
  solubility curve with the freezing-point curve. Since this point is
  fixed, the condition of the system as regards temperature, vapour
  pressure, and concentration of the components (or composition of the
  solution), is perfectly definite. From the way, also, in which the
  condition is attained, it is evident that the quadruple point is the
  lowest temperature that can be obtained with mixtures of the two
  components in presence of vapour. It is known as the <i>cryohydric
  point</i>, or, generally, the <i>eutectic point</i>.<a name="NtA194"

  <p><b>Cryohydrates.</b><a name="NtA195"
  href="#Nt195"><sup>[195]</sup></a>&mdash;On cooling a solution of common
  salt in water to a temperature of -3°, Guthrie observed that the hydrate
  NaCl,2H<sub>2</sub>O separated out. This salt continued to be deposited
  until at a temperature of -22° opaque crystals made their appearance, and
  the liquid passed into the solid state without change of temperature. A
  similar behaviour was found by Guthrie in the case of a large number of
  other salts, a temperature below that of the melting point of ice being
  reached at which on continued withdrawal of heat, the solution solidified
  at a constant temperature. When the system had attained this minimum
  temperature, it was found that the composition of the solid and the
  liquid phases was the same, and remained unchanged throughout the period
  of solidification. This is shown by the following figures, which give the
  composition of different samples of the solid phase deposited from the
  solution at constant temperature.<a name="NtA196"

  <p>Conversely, a mixture of ice and salt containing 23.6 per cent. of
  sodium chloride will melt at a definite and constant temperature, and
  exhibit, therefore, a behaviour supposed to be characteristic of a pure
  chemical compound. This, then, combined with the fact that the solid
  which was deposited was crystalline, and that the same constant
  temperature was attained, no matter with what proportions of water and
  salt one started, led Guthrie to the belief that the solids which thus
  separated at constant temperature were definite chemical compounds, to
  which he gave the general name <i>cryohydrate</i>. A large number of such
  cryohydrates were prepared and analysed by Guthrie, and a few of these
  are given in the following table, together with the temperature of the

  <p>The chemical individuality of these cryohydrates was, however, called
  in question by Pfaundler,<a name="NtA198"
  href="#Nt198"><sup>[198]</sup></a> and disproved by Offer,<a
  name="NtA199" href="#Nt199"><sup>[199]</sup></a> who showed that in spite
  of the constancy of the melting point, the cryohydrates had the
  properties, not of definite chemical compounds, but of mixtures; the
  arguments given being that the heat of solution and the specific volume
  are the same for the cryohydrate as for a mixture of ice and salt of the
  same composition; and it was further shown that the cryohydrate had not a
  definite crystalline form, but separated out as an opaque mass containing
  the two components in close juxtaposition. The heterogeneous nature of
  cryohydrates can also be shown by a microscopical examination.</p>

  <p>At the cryohydric point, therefore, we are not dealing with a single
  solid phase, but with two solid phases, ice and salt; the cryohydric
  point, therefore, as already stated, is a quadruple point and represents
  an invariant system.</p>

  <p>Although on cooling a solution to the cryohydric point, separation of
  ice may occur, it will not necessarily take place; the system may become
  metastable. Similarly, separation of salt may not take place immediately
  the cryohydric point is reached. It will, therefore, be possible to
  follow the curves BO and AO beyond the quadruple point,<a name="NtA200"
  href="#Nt200"><sup>[200]</sup></a> which is thereby clearly seen to be
  the point of intersection of the solubility curve of the salt and the
  freezing-point curve of ice. At this point, also, the curves of the
  univariant systems ice&mdash;salt&mdash;vapour and
  ice&mdash;salt&mdash;solution intersect.</p>

  <p><b>Changes at the Quadruple Point.</b>&mdash;Since the invariant
  system ice&mdash;salt&mdash;solution&mdash;vapour can exist only at a
  definite temperature, addition or withdrawal of heat must cause the
  disappearance of one of the phases, whereby the system will become
  univariant. So long as all four phases are present the temperature,
  pressure, and concentration of the components in the solution must remain
  constant. When, therefore, heat is added to or withdrawn from the system,
  mutually compensatory changes will take place within the system whereby
  the <!-- Page 120 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page120"></a>{120}</span>condition of the latter is preserved.
  These changes can in all cases be foreseen with the help of the theorem
  of van't Hoff and Le Chatelier; and, after what was said in Chap. IV.,
  need only be briefly referred to here. In the first place, addition of
  heat will cause ice to melt, and the concentration of the solution will
  be thereby altered; salt must therefore dissolve until the original
  concentration is reached, and the heat of fusion of ice will be
  counteracted by the heat of solution of the salt. Changes of volume of
  the solid and liquid phases must also be taken into account; an
  alteration in the volume of these phases being compensated by
  condensation or evaporation. All four phases will therefore be involved
  in the change, and the final state of the system will be dependent on the
  amounts of the different phases present; the ultimate result of addition
  or withdrawal of heat or of change of pressure at the quadruple point
  will be one of the four univariant systems:
  ice&mdash;solution&mdash;vapour; salt&mdash;solution&mdash;vapour;
  ice&mdash;salt&mdash;vapour; ice&mdash;salt&mdash;solution. If the vapour
  phase disappear, there will be left the univariant system
  ice&mdash;salt&mdash;solution, and the temperature at which this system
  can exist will alter with the pressure. Since in this case the influence
  of pressure is comparatively slight, the temperature of the quadruple
  point will differ only slightly from that of the cryohydric point as
  determined under atmospheric pressure.</p>

  <p><b>Freezing Mixtures.</b>&mdash;Not only will the composition of a
  univariant system undergo change when the temperature is varied, but,
  conversely, if the <i>composition</i> of the system is caused to change,
  corresponding changes of temperature must ensue. Thus, if ice is added to
  the univariant system salt&mdash;solution&mdash;vapour, the ice must melt
  and the temperature fall; and if sufficient ice is added, the temperature
  of the cryohydric point must be at length reached, for it is only at this
  temperature that the four phases
  ice&mdash;salt&mdash;solution&mdash;vapour can coexist. Or, on the other
  hand, if salt is added to the system ice&mdash;solution&mdash;vapour, the
  concentration of the solution will increase, ice must melt, and the
  temperature must thereby fall; and this process also will go on until the
  cryohydric point is reached. In both cases ice melts and there is a
  change in the <!-- Page 121 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page121"></a>{121}</span>composition of the solution; in the former
  case, salt will be deposited<a name="NtA201"
  href="#Nt201"><sup>[201]</sup></a> because the solubility diminishes as
  the temperature falls; in the latter, salt will pass into solution. This
  process may be accompanied either by an evolution or, more generally, by
  absorption of heat; in the former case the effect of the addition of ice
  will be partially counteracted; in the latter case it will be
  augmented.</p>

  <p>These principles are made use of in the preparation of <i>freezing
  mixtures</i>. The lowest temperature which can be reached by means of
  these (under atmospheric pressure) is the cryohydric point. This
  temperature-minimum is, however, not always attained in the preparation
  of a freezing mixture, and that for various reasons. The chief of these
  are radiation and the heat absorbed in cooling the solution produced. The
  lower the temperature falls, the more rapid does the radiation become;
  and the rate at which the temperature sinks decreases as the amount of
  solution increases. Both these factors counteract the effect of the
  latent heat of fusion and the heat of solution, so that a point is
  reached (which may lie considerably above the cryohydric point) at which
  the two opposing influences balance. The absorption of heat by the
  solution can be diminished by allowing the solution to drain off as fast
  as it is produced; and the effect of radiation can be partially annulled
  by increasing the rate of cooling. This can be done by the more intimate
  mixing of the components. Since, under atmospheric pressure, the
  temperature of the cryohydric point is constant, the cryohydrates are
  very valuable for the production of baths of constant low
  temperature.</p>

<p class="cenhead">2. <i>Partial Miscibility of the Fused Components.</i></p>

  <p>On passing to the study of the second class of systems of two
  components belonging to this group, namely, those in which the fused
  components are not miscible in all proportions, we find that the
  relationships are not quite so simple as <!-- Page 122 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page122"></a>{122}</span>in the case of silver
  nitrate and water. In the latter case, only one liquid phase was
  possible; in the cases now to be studied, two liquid phases can be
  formed, and there is a marked discontinuity in the solubility curve on
  passing from the cryohydric point to the melting point of the second
  (non-volatile) component.</p>

  <p>Paratoluidine dissolves in water, and the solubility increases as the
  temperature rises.<a name="NtA202" href="#Nt202"><sup>[202]</sup></a> At
  44.2°, however, paratoluidine in contact with water melts, and two liquid
  phases are formed, viz. a solution of water in fused paratoluidine and a
  solution of fused paratoluidine in water. We have, therefore, the
  phenomenon of <i>melting under the solvent</i>. This melting point will,
  of course, be lower than the melting point of the pure substance, because
  the solid is now in contact with a solution, and, as we have already
  seen, addition of a foreign substance lowers the melting point. Such
  cases of melting under the solvent are by no means rare, and a review of
  the relationships met with may, therefore, be undertaken here. As an
  example, there may be chosen the equilibrium between succinic nitrile,
  C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(CN)<sub>2</sub> and water, which has been
  fully studied by Schreinemakers.<a name="NtA203"
  href="#Nt203"><sup>[203]</sup></a></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:29%;">
      <a href="images/fig030.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig030.png"
      alt="Fig. 30" title="Fig. 30" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 30.
  </div>

  <p>If to the system ice&mdash;water at 0° succinic nitrile is added, the
  temperature will fall; and continued addition of the nitrile will lead at
  last to the cryohydric point <i>b</i> (Fig. 30), at which solid nitrile,
  ice, solution, and vapour can coexist. The temperature of the cryohydric
  point is -1.2°, and the composition of the solution is 1.29 mol. of
  nitrile in 100 mol. of solution. From <i>a</i> to <i>b</i> the solid
  phase in contact with the solution is ice. <!-- Page 123 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page123"></a>{123}</span>If the temperature be
  now raised so as to cause the disappearance of the ice, and the addition
  of nitrile be continued, the concentration of the nitrile in the solution
  will increase as represented by the curve <i>bc</i>. At the point
  <i>c</i> (18.5°), when the concentration of the nitrile in the solution
  has increased to 2.5 molecules per cent., the nitrile melts and two
  liquid phases are formed; the concentration of the nitrile in these two
  phases is given by the points <i>c</i> and <i>c&prime;</i>. As there are
  now four phases present, viz. solid nitrile, solution of fused nitrile in
  water, solution of water in fused nitrile, and vapour, the system is
  <i>invariant</i>. Since at this point the concentration, temperature, and
  pressure are completely defined, addition or withdrawal of heat can only
  cause a change in the relative amounts of the phases, <i>but no variation
  of the concentrations</i> of the respective phases. As a matter of fact,
  continued addition of nitrile and addition of heat will cause an increase
  in the amount of the liquid phase containing excess of nitrile
  (<i>i.e.</i> the solution of water in fused nitrile), whereas the other
  liquid phase, the solution of fused nitrile in water, will gradually
  disappear. When it has completely disappeared, the system will be
  represented by the point <i>c&prime;</i>, where the molecular
  concentration of nitrile is now 75 per cent., and again becomes
  univariant, the three phases being solid nitrile, liquid phase containing
  excess of nitrile, and vapour; and as the amount of the water is
  diminished the temperature of equilibrium rises, until at 54° the melting
  point of the pure nitrile is reached.</p>

  <p>Return now to the point <i>c</i>. At this point there exists the
  invariant system solid nitrile, two liquid phases, vapour. If heat be
  added, the solid nitrile will disappear, and there will be left the
  univariant system, consisting of two liquid phases and vapour.<a
  name="NtA204" href="#Nt204"><sup>[204]</sup></a> Such a system will
  exhibit relationships similar to those already studied in the previous
  chapter. As the temperature rises, the mutual solubility of the two fused
  components becomes greater, until at <i>d</i> (55.5°) the critical
  solution temperature is reached, and the fused components become miscible
  in all proportions.</p>

  <p>At all temperatures and concentrations lying to the right <!-- Page
  124 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page124"></a>{124}</span>of the
  curve <i>abcdc&prime;e</i> there can be only one liquid phase; in the
  field <i>cdc&prime;</i> there are two liquid phases.</p>

  <p>From the figure it will be easy to see what will be the result of
  bringing together succinic nitrile and water at different temperatures
  and in different amounts. Since <i>b</i> is the lowest temperature at
  which liquid can exist in stable equilibrium with solid, ice and succinic
  nitrile can be mixed in any proportions at temperatures below <i>b</i>
  without undergoing change. Between <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> succinic nitrile
  will be dissolved until the concentration reaches the value on the curve
  <i>bc</i>, corresponding to the given temperature. On adding the nitrile
  to water at temperatures between <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>, it will dissolve
  until a concentration lying on the curve <i>cd</i> is attained; at this
  point two liquid phases will be formed, and further addition of nitrile
  will cause the one liquid phase (that containing excess of nitrile) to
  increase, while the other liquid phase will decrease, until it finally
  disappears and there is only one liquid phase left, that containing
  excess of nitrile. This can dissolve further quantities of the nitrile,
  and the concentration will increase until the curve <i>c&prime;e</i> is
  reached, when the concentration will remain unchanged, and addition of
  solid will merely increase the amount of the solid phase.</p>

  <p>If a solution represented by any point in the field lying below the
  curve <i>bcd</i> is heated to a temperature above <i>d</i>, the critical
  solution temperature, then the concentration of the nitrile can be
  increased to any desired amount without at any time two liquid phases
  making their appearance; the system can then be cooled down to a
  temperature represented by any point between the curves
  <i>dc&prime;e</i>. In this way it is possible to pass continuously from a
  solution containing excess of one component to solutions containing
  excess of the other, as represented by the dotted line <i>xxxx</i>
  (<i>v.</i> p.&nbsp;<a href="#page100">100</a>). At no point is there formation
  of two liquid phases.</p>

  <p><b>Supersaturation.</b>&mdash;Just as suspended transformation is
  rarely met with in the passage from the solid to the liquid state, so
  also it is found in the case of the melting of substances under the
  solvent that suspended fusion does not occur; but that when the
  temperature of the invariant point is reached at which, therefore, the
  formation of two liquid layers is possible, <!-- Page 125 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page125"></a>{125}</span>these two liquid
  layers, as a matter of fact, make their appearance. Suspended
  transformation can, however, take place from the side of the liquid
  phase, just as water or other liquid can be cooled below the normal
  freezing point without solidification occurring. The question, therefore,
  arises as to the relative solubilities of the solid and the supercooled
  liquid at the same temperature.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:31%;">
      <a href="images/fig031.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig031.png"
      alt="Fig. 31" title="Fig. 31" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 31.
  </div>

  <p>The answer to this question can at once be given from what we have
  already learned (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page113">113</a>), if we recollect that at
  temperatures below the point of fusion under the solvent, the solid form,
  at temperatures above that point, the liquid form, is the more stable; at
  this temperature, therefore, the relative stability of the solid and
  liquid forms changes. Since, as we have already seen, the less stable
  form has the greater solubility, it follows that the supercooled liquid,
  being the less stable form, must have the greater solubility. This was
  first proved experimentally by Alexejeff<a name="NtA205"
  href="#Nt205"><sup>[205]</sup></a> in the case of benzoic acid and water,
  the solubility curves for which are given in Fig. 31. As can be seen from
  the figure, the prolongation of the curve for liquid&mdash;liquid, which
  represents the solubility of the supercooled liquid benzoic acid, lies
  above that for the solubility of the <!-- Page 126 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page126"></a>{126}</span>solid benzoic acid in
  water; the solution saturated with respect to the supercooled liquid is
  therefore supersaturated with respect to the solid form. A similar
  behaviour has been found in the case of other substances.<a name="NtA206"
  href="#Nt206"><sup>[206]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Pressure-Temperature Diagram.</b>&mdash;Having considered the
  changes which occur in the concentration of the components in a solution
  with the temperature, we may conclude the discussion of the equilibrium
  between a salt and water by studying the variation of the vapour
  pressure.</p>

  <p>Since in systems of two components the two phases, solution and
  vapour, constitute a bivariant system, the vapour pressure is undefined,
  and may have different values at the same temperature, depending on the
  concentration. In order that there may be for each temperature a definite
  corresponding pressure of the vapour, a third phase must be present. This
  condition is satisfied by the system solid&mdash;liquid
  (solution)&mdash;vapour; that is, by the saturated solution (p.&nbsp;<a
  href="#page108">108</a>). In the case of a saturated solution, therefore,
  the pressure of the vapour at any given temperature is constant.</p>

  <p><b>Vapour Pressure of Solid&mdash;Solution&mdash;Vapour.</b>&mdash;It
  has long been known that the addition of a non-volatile solid to a liquid
  in which it is soluble lowers the vapour pressure of the solvent; and the
  diminution of the pressure is approximately proportional to the amount of
  substance dissolved (Law of Babo). The vapour-pressure curve, therefore,
  of a solution of a salt in water must lie below that for pure water.
  Further, in the case of a pure liquid, the vaporization curve is a
  function only of the temperature (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page63">63</a>), whereas,
  in the case of a solution, the pressure varies both with the temperature
  and the <i>concentration</i>. These two factors, however, act in opposite
  directions; for although the vapour pressure in all cases increases as
  the temperature rises, increase of concentration, as we have seen, lowers
  the vapour pressure. Again, since the concentration itself varies with
  the temperature, two cases have to be considered, viz. where the
  concentration increases with rise of <!-- Page 127 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page127"></a>{127}</span>temperature, and where
  the concentration diminishes with rise of temperature.</p>

  <p>The relations which are found here will be best understood with the
  help of Fig. 32.<a name="NtA207" href="#Nt207"><sup>[207]</sup></a> In
  this figure, OB represents the sublimation curve of ice, and BC the
  vaporization curve of water; the curve for the solution must lie below
  this, and must cut the sublimation curve of ice at some temperature below
  the melting point. The point of intersection A is the cryohydric point.
  If the solubility increases with rise of temperature, the increase of the
  vapour pressure due to the latter will be partially annulled. Since at
  first the effect of increase of temperature more than counteracts the
  depressing action of increase of concentration, the vapour pressure will
  increase on raising the temperature above the cryohydric point. If the
  elevation of temperature is continued, however, to the melting point of
  the salt, the effect of increasing concentration makes itself more and
  more felt, so that the vapour-pressure curve of the solution falls more
  and more below that of the pure liquid, and the pressure will ultimately
  become equal to that of the pure salt; that is to say, practically equal
  to zero. The curve will therefore be of the general form AMF shown in
  Fig. 32. If the solubility should diminish with rise of temperature, the
  two factors, temperature and concentration, will act in the same
  direction, and the vapour-pressure curve will rise relatively more rapid
  than that of the pure liquid; since, however, the pure salt is ultimately
  obtained, the vapour-pressure curve must in this case also finally
  approach the value zero.</p>

  <p><b>Other Univariant Systems.</b>&mdash;Besides the univariant system
  <!-- Page 128 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page128"></a>{128}</span>salt&mdash;solution&mdash;vapour already
  considered, three others are possible, viz.
  ice&mdash;solution&mdash;vapour, ice&mdash;salt&mdash;solution, and
  ice&mdash;salt&mdash;vapour.</p>

  <p>The fusion point of a substance is lowered, as we have seen, by the
  addition of a foreign substance, and the depression is all the greater
  the larger the quantity of substance added. The vapour pressure of the
  water, also, is lowered by the solution in it of other substances, so
  that the vapour pressure of the system ice&mdash;solution&mdash;vapour
  must decrease as the temperature falls from the fusion point of ice to
  the cryohydric point. This curve is represented by BA (Fig. 32), and is
  coincident with the sublimation curve of ice.</p>

  <p>This, at first sight, strange fact will be readily understood when we
  consider that since ice and solution are together in equilibrium with the
  same vapour, they must have the same vapour pressure. For suppose at any
  given temperature equilibrium to have been established in the system
  ice&mdash;solution&mdash;vapour, removal of the ice will not alter this
  equilibrium. Suppose, now, the ice and the solution placed under a
  bell-jar so that they have a common vapour, but are not themselves in
  contact; then, if they do not have the same vapour pressure, distillation
  must take place and the solution will become more dilute or more
  concentrated. Since, at the completion of this process, the ice and
  solution are now in equilibrium when they are not in contact, they must
  also be in equilibrium when they are in contact (p.&nbsp;<a
  href="#page32">32</a>). But if distillation has taken place the
  concentration of the solution must have altered, so that the ice will now
  be in equilibrium with a solution of a different concentration from
  before. But according to the Phase Rule ice cannot at one and the same
  temperature be in equilibrium with two solutions of different
  concentration, for the system ice&mdash;solution&mdash;vapour is
  univariant, and at any given temperature, therefore, not only the
  pressure but also the <i>concentration of the components in the solution
  must be constant</i>. Distillation could not, therefore, take place from
  the ice to the solution or <i>vice versâ</i>; that is to say, the
  solution and the ice must have the same vapour pressure&mdash;the
  sublimation pressure of ice. The reason of the coincidence is the
  non-volatility of the salt: had <!-- Page 129 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page129"></a>{129}</span>the salt a measurable vapour pressure
  itself, the sublimation curve of ice and the curve for
  ice&mdash;solution&mdash;vapour would no longer fall together.</p>

  <p>The curve AO represents the pressures of the system
  ice&mdash;salt&mdash;vapour. This curve will also be coincident with the
  sublimation curve of ice, on account of the non-volatility of the
  salt.</p>

  <p>The equilibria of the fourth univariant system
  ice&mdash;salt&mdash;solution are represented by AE. Since this is a
  condensed system, the effect of a small change of temperature will be to
  cause a large change of pressure, as in the case of the fusion point of a
  pure substance. The direction of this curve will depend on whether there
  is an increase or diminution of volume on solidification; but the effect
  in any given case can be predicted with the help of the theorem of Le
  Chatelier.</p>

  <p>Since the cryohydric point is a quadruple point in a two-component
  system, it represents an invariant system. The condition of the system
  is, therefore, completely defined; the four phases, ice, salt, solution,
  vapour, can co-exist only when the temperature, pressure, and
  concentration of the solution have constant and definite values. Addition
  or withdrawal of heat, therefore, can cause no alteration of the
  condition of the system except a variation of the relative amounts of the
  phases. Addition of heat at constant volume will ultimately lead to the
  system salt&mdash;solution&mdash;vapour or the system
  ice&mdash;solution&mdash;vapour, according as ice or salt disappears
  first. This is readily apparent from the diagram (Fig. 32), for the
  systems ice&mdash;salt&mdash;solution and ice&mdash;salt&mdash;vapour can
  exist only at temperatures below the cryohydric point (provided the curve
  for ice&mdash;salt&mdash;solution slopes towards the pressure axis).</p>

  <p><b>Bivariant Systems.</b>&mdash;Besides the univariant systems already
  discussed, various bivariant systems are possible, the conditions for the
  existence of which are represented by the different areas of Fig. 32.
  They are as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p><b>Deliquescence.</b>&mdash;As is evident from Fig. 32, salt can exist
  in contact with water vapour at pressures under those represented by
  OAMF. If, however, the pressure of the vapour is increased until it
  reaches a value lying on this curve at temperatures above the cryohydric
  point, solution will be formed; for the curve AMF represents the
  equilibria between salt&mdash;solution&mdash;vapour. From this,
  therefore, it is clear that if the pressure of the aqueous vapour in the
  atmosphere is greater than that of the saturated solution of a salt, that
  salt will, on being placed in the air, form a solution; it will
  <i>deliquesce</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Separation of Salt on Evaporation.</b>&mdash;With the help of Fig.
  32 it is possible to state in a general manner whether or not salt will
  be deposited when a solution is evaporated under a constant pressure.<a
  name="NtA208" href="#Nt208"><sup>[208]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The curve AMF (Fig. 32) is the vapour-pressure curve of the saturated
  solutions of the salt, <i>i.e.</i> it represents, as we have seen, the
  maximum vapour pressure at which salt can exist in contact with solution
  and vapour. The dotted line <i>aa</i> represents atmospheric pressure.
  If, now, an unsaturated solution, the composition of which is represented
  by the point <i>x</i>, is heated in an open vessel, the temperature will
  rise, and the vapour pressure of the solution will increase. The system
  will, therefore, pass along a line represented diagrammatically by
  <i>xx&prime;</i>. At the point <i>x&prime;</i> the vapour pressure of the
  system becomes equal to 1 atm.; and as the vessel is open to the air, the
  pressure cannot further rise; the solution boils. If the heating is
  continued, water passes off, the concentration increases, and the boiling
  point rises. The system will therefore pass along the line
  <i>x&prime;m</i>, until at the point <i>m</i> solid salt separates out
  (provided supersaturation is excluded). The system is now univariant, and
  continued heating will no longer cause an alteration of the
  concentration; as water passes off, solid salt will be deposited, and the
  solution will evaporate to dryness.</p>

  <p>If, however, the atmospheric pressure is represented not by <i>aa</i>
  but by <i>bb</i>, then, as Fig. 32 shows, the maximum vapour <!-- Page
  131 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page131"></a>{131}</span>pressure
  of the system salt&mdash;solution&mdash;vapour never reaches the pressure
  of 1 atm. Further, since the curve <i>bb</i> lies in the area of the
  bivariant system solution&mdash;vapour there can at no point be a
  separation of the solid form; for the system
  solid&mdash;solution&mdash;vapour can exist only along the curve AMF.</p>

  <p>On evaporating the solution of a salt in an open vessel, therefore,
  salt can be deposited only if at some temperature the pressure of the
  saturated solution is equal to the atmospheric pressure. This is found to
  be the case with most salts. In the case of aqueous solutions of sodium
  and potassium hydroxide, however, the vapour pressure of the saturated
  solution never reaches the value of 1 atm., and on evaporating these
  solutions, therefore, in an open vessel, there is no separation of the
  solid. Only a homogeneous fused mass is obtained. If, however, the
  evaporation be carried out under a pressure which is lower than the
  maximum pressure of the saturated solution, separation of the solid
  substance will be possible.</p>

  <p><b>General Summary.</b>&mdash;The systems which have been discussed in
  the present chapter contained water as one of their components, and an
  anhydrous salt as the other. It will, however, be clear that the
  relationships which were found in the case of these will be found also in
  other cases where it is a question of the equilibria between two
  components, which crystallize out in the pure state, and only one of
  which possesses a measurable vapour pressure. A similar behaviour will,
  for example, be found in the case of many pairs of organic substances;
  and in all cases the equilibria will be represented by a diagram of the
  general appearance of Fig. 29 or Fig. 30. That is to say: Starting from
  the fusion point of component I., the system will pass, by progressive
  addition of component II., to regions of lower temperature, until at last
  the cryohydric or eutectic point is reached. On further addition of
  component II., the system will pass to regions of higher temperature, the
  solid phase now being component II. If the fused components are miscible
  with one another in all proportions a continuous curve will be obtained
  leading up to the point of fusion of component II. Slight changes of
  direction, it is true, due to changes in the crystalline form, may be
  found along this curve, <!-- Page 132 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page132"></a>{132}</span>but throughout its whole course there will
  be but one liquid phase. If, on the other hand, the fused components are
  not miscible in all proportions, then the second curve will exhibit a
  marked discontinuity, and two liquid phases will make their
  appearance.</p>

<p class="cenhead">SOLUTIONS OF SOLIDS IN LIQUIDS, ONLY ONE OF
THE COMPONENTS BEING VOLATILE</p>

<p class="cenhead">B.&mdash;<span class="sc">Hydrated Salt and Water.</span></p>

  <p>In the preceding chapter we discussed the behaviour of systems formed
  of two components, only one of which was volatile, in those cases where
  the two components separated from solution in the pure state. In the
  present chapter we shall consider those systems in which combination
  between the components can occur with the formation of definite
  compounds; such as are found in the case of crystalline salt hydrates.
  Since a not inconsiderable amount of study has been devoted to the
  systems formed by hydrated salts and water, systems which are of great
  chemical interest and importance, the behaviour of these will first call
  for discussion in some detail, and it will be found later that the
  relationships which exist in such systems appear also in a large number
  of other two-component systems.</p>

  <p>The systems belonging to this group may be divided into two classes
  according as the compounds formed possess a definite melting point,
  <i>i.e.</i> form a liquid phase of the same composition, or do not do so.
  We shall consider the latter first.</p>

<p class="cenhead">1. <i>The Compounds formed do not have a Definite Melting Point.</i></p>

  <p><b>Concentration-Temperature Diagram.</b>&mdash;In the case of salts
  which can form crystalline hydrates, the temperature-concentration
  diagram, representing the equilibria of the <!-- Page 134 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page134"></a>{134}</span>different possible
  systems, must necessarily be somewhat more complicated than where no such
  combination of the components occurs. For, as has already been pointed
  out, each substance has its own solubility curve; and there will
  therefore be as many solubility curves as there are solid phases
  possible, <i>the curve for each particular solid phase being continuous
  so long as it remains unchanged in contact with the solution</i>. As an
  example of the relationships met with in such cases, we shall first of
  all consider the systems formed of sodium sulphate and water.</p>

  <p>On continuing the investigation at higher temperatures, it was found
  that the solubility no longer increased, but <i>decreased with rise of
  temperature</i>. At the same time, it was observed that the solid phase
  was now different from that in contact with the solution at temperatures
  below 33°; for whereas in the latter case the solid phase was sodium
  sulphate decahydrate, at temperatures above 33° the solid phase was the
  anhydrous salt. The course of the solubility curve of anhydrous sodium

  <p>Since, as has already been stated, each solid substance has its own
  solubility curve, there are three separate curves to be considered in the
  case of sodium sulphate and water. Where two curves cut, the solution
  must be saturated with respect to two solid phases; at the point B,
  therefore, the point of intersection of the solubility curve of anhydrous
  sodium sulphate with that of the decahydrate, the solution must be
  saturated with respect to these two solid substances. But a system of two
  components existing in four phases, anhydrous salt&mdash;hydrated
  salt&mdash;solution&mdash;vapour, is invariant; and this invariability
  will remain even if only three phases are present, provided that one of
  the factors, pressure, temperature, or concentration of components
  retains a constant value. This is the case when solubilities are
  determined in open vessels; the pressure is then equal to atmospheric
  pressure. Under these circumstances, then, the system, anhydrous sodium
  sulphate&mdash;decahydrate&mdash;solution, will possess no degree of
  freedom, and can exist, therefore, only at one definite temperature and
  when the solution has a certain definite composition. The temperature of
  this point is 32.482° on a mercury thermometer, or 32.379° on the
  hydrogen thermometer.<a name="NtA211"
  href="#Nt211"><sup>[211]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 137 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page137"></a>{137}</span></p>

  <p><b>Suspended Transformation.</b>&mdash;Although it is possible for the
  anhydrous salt to make its appearance at the temperature of the quadruple
  point, it will not necessarily do so; and it is therefore possible to
  follow the solubility curve of sodium sulphate decahydrate to a higher
  temperature. Since, however, the solubility of the decahydrate at
  temperatures above the quadruple point is greater than that of the
  anhydrous salt, the solution which is <i>saturated</i> with respect to
  the former will be <i>supersaturated</i> with respect to the latter. On
  bringing a small quantity of the anhydrous salt in contact with the
  solution, therefore, anhydrous salt will be deposited; and all the
  hydrated salt present will ultimately undergo conversion into the
  anhydrous salt, through the medium of the solution. In this case, as in
  all cases, the solid phase, which is the most stable at the temperature
  of the experiment, has at that temperature the least solubility.</p>

  <p>Similarly, the solubility curve of anhydrous sodium sulphate has been
  followed to temperatures below 32.5°. Below this temperature, however,
  the solubility of this salt is greater than that of the decahydrate, and
  the saturated solution of the anhydrous salt will therefore be
  supersaturated for the decahydrate, and will deposit this salt if a
  "nucleus" is added to the solution. From this we see that at temperatures
  above 32.5° the anhydrous salt is the stable form, while the decahydrate
  is unstable (or metastable); at temperatures below 32.5° the decahydrate
  is stable. This temperature, therefore, is the <i>transition
  temperature</i> for decahydrate and anhydrous salt.</p>

  <p>From Fig. 33 we see further that the solubility curve of the anhydrous
  salt (which at all temperatures below 32.5° is metastable) is cut by the
  solubility curve of the heptahydrate; and this point of intersection (at
  a temperature of 24.2°) must be the <i>transition point</i> for
  heptahydrate and anhydrous salt. Since at all temperatures the solubility
  of the heptahydrate is greater than that of the decahydrate, the former
  hydrate must be metastable with respect to the latter; so that throughout
  its whole course the solubility curve of the heptahydrate <!-- Page 138
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page138"></a>{138}</span>represents
  only metastable equilibria. Sodium sulphate, therefore, forms only one
  stable hydrate, the decahydrate.</p>

  <p>The solubility relations of sodium sulphate illustrate very clearly
  the importance of the solid phase for the definition of saturation and
  supersaturation. Since the solubility curve of the anhydrous salt has
  been followed backwards to a temperature of about 18°, it is readily
  seen, from Fig. 33, that at a temperature of, say, 20° three different
  <i>saturated</i> solutions of sodium sulphate are possible, according as
  the anhydrous salt, the heptahydrate or the decahydrate, is present as
  the solid phase. Two of these solutions, however, would be metastable and
  <i>supersaturated with respect to the decahydrate</i>.</p>

  <p>Further, the behaviour of sodium sulphate and water furnishes a very
  good example of the fact that a "break" in the solubility curve occurs
  when, and only when, the solid phase undergoes change. So long as the
  decahydrate, for example, remained unaltered in contact with the
  solution, the solubility curve was continuous; but when the anhydrous
  salt appeared in the solid phase, a distinct change in the direction of
  the solubility curve was observed.</p>

  <p><b>Dehydration by Means of Anhydrous Sodium Sulphate.</b>&mdash;The
  change in the relative stability of sodium sulphate decahydrate and
  anhydrous salt in presence of water at a temperature of 32.5° explains
  why the latter salt cannot be employed for dehydration purposes at
  temperatures above the transition point. The dehydrating action of the
  anhydrous salt depends on the formation of the decahydrate; but since at
  temperatures above 33° the latter is unstable, and cannot be formed in
  presence of the anhydrous salt, this salt cannot, of course, effect a
  dehydration above that temperature.</p>

  <p><b>Pressure-Temperature Diagram.</b>&mdash;The consideration of the
  pressure-temperature relations of the two components, sodium sulphate and
  water, must include not only the vapour pressure of the saturated
  solutions, but also that of the crystalline hydrates. The vapour
  pressures of salt hydrates have already been treated in a general manner
  (Chap. V.), so that it is only necessary here to point out the connection
  between the two classes of systems. <!-- Page 139 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page139"></a>{139}</span></p>

  <p>In most cases the vapour pressure of a salt hydrate, <i>i.e.</i> the
  vapour pressure of the system hydrate&mdash;anhydrous salt (or lower
  hydrate)&mdash;vapour, is at all temperatures lower than that of the
  system anhydrous salt (or lower hydrate)&mdash;solution&mdash;vapour.
  This, however, is not a necessity; and cases are known where the vapour
  pressure of the former system is, under certain circumstances, equal to
  or higher than that of the latter. An example of this is found in sodium
  sulphate decahydrate.</p>

  <p>On heating Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,10H<sub>2</sub>O, a point is
  reached at which the dissociation pressure into anhydrous salt and water
  vapour becomes equal to the vapour pressure of the saturated solution of
  the anhydrous salt, as is apparent from the following measurements;<a

  <p>At 32.6°, therefore, the vapour pressures of the two systems</p>

  <p>are equal; at this temperature the four phases,
  Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,10H<sub>2</sub>O;

  is evident that when sodium sulphate decahydrate is heated to 32.6°, the
  two new phases anhydrous salt and solution will be formed (suspended
  transformation being supposed excluded), and the hydrate will appear to
  undergo <i>partial fusion</i>; and during the process of "melting" the
  vapour pressure and temperature will remain constant.<a name="NtA213"
  href="#Nt213"><sup>[213]</sup></a> This is, however, not a true but a
  so-called <i>incongruent</i> melting point; for the composition of the
  liquid phase is not the same as that of the solid. As has already been
  pointed out (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page137">137</a>), we are dealing here with the
  <i>transition point</i> of the decahydrate and anhydrous salt,
  <i>i.e.</i> with the reaction

  <p>Since at the point of partial fusion of the decahydrate four <!-- Page
  140 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page140"></a>{140}</span>phases can
  coexist, the point is a quadruple point in a two-component system, and
  the system at this point is therefore invariant. The temperature of this
  point is therefore perfectly definite, and on this account the proposal
  has been made to adopt this as a fixed point in thermometry.<a
  name="NtA214" href="#Nt214"><sup>[214]</sup></a> The temperature is, of
  course, practically the same as that at which the two solubility curves
  intersect (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page112">112</a>). If, however, the vapour phase
  disappears, the system becomes univariant, and the equilibrium
  temperature undergoes change with change of pressure. The transition
  curve has been determined by Tammann,<a name="NtA215"
  href="#Nt215"><sup>[215]</sup></a> and shown to pass through a point of
  maximum temperature.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 34.

  <p>The vapour pressure of the different systems of sodium sulphate and
  water can best be studied with the help of the diagram in Fig. 34.<a
  name="NtA216" href="#Nt216"><sup>[216]</sup></a> The curve ABCD
  represents the vapour-pressure curve of the saturated solution of
  anhydrous sodium sulphate. GC is the pressure curve of decahydrate +
  anhydrous salt, which, as we have seen, cuts the curve ABCD at the
  transition temperature, 32.6°. Since at this point the solution is
  saturated with respect to both the anhydrous salt and the decahydrate,
  the vapour-pressure curve of the saturated solution of the latter must
  also pass through the point C.<a name="NtA217"
  href="#Nt217"><sup>[217]</sup></a> As at temperatures below this point
  the solubility of the decahydrate is less than that of the anhydrous
  salt, the vapour pressure of the solution will, in accordance with Babo's
  law (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page126">126</a>), be higher than that of the solution
  of the anhydrous salt; which was also found experimentally to be the case
  (curve HC).</p>

<p><!-- Page 141 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page141"></a>{141}</span></p>

  <p>In connection with the vapour pressure of the saturated solutions of
  the anhydrous salt and the decahydrate, attention must be drawn to a
  conspicuous deviation from what was found to hold in the case of
  one-component systems in which a vapour phase was present (p.&nbsp;<a
  href="#page31">31</a>). There, it was seen that the vapour pressure of
  the more stable system was always <i>lower</i> than that of the less
  stable; in the present case, however, we find that this is no longer so.
  We have already learned that at temperatures below 32.5° the system
  decahydrate&mdash;solution&mdash;vapour is more stable than the system
  anhydrous salt&mdash;solution&mdash;vapour; but the vapour pressure of
  the latter system is, as has just been stated, lower than that of the
  former. At temperatures above the transition point the vapour pressure of
  the saturated solution of the decahydrate will be lower than that of the
  saturated solution of the anhydrous salt.</p>

  <p>This behaviour depends on the fact that the less stable form is the
  more soluble, and that the diminution of the vapour pressure increases
  with the amount of salt dissolved.</p>

  <p>With regard to sodium sulphate heptahydrate the same considerations
  will hold as in the case of the decahydrate. Since at 24° the four phases
  heptahydrate, anhydrous salt, solution, vapour can coexist, the
  vapour-pressure curves of the systems hydrate&mdash;anhydrous
  salt&mdash;vapour (curve EB) and hydrate&mdash;solution&mdash;vapour
  (curve FB) must cut the pressure curve of the saturated solution of the
  anhydrous salt at the above temperature, as represented in Fig. 34 by the
  point B. This constitutes, therefore, a second quadruple point, which is,
  however, metastable.</p>

  <p>From the diagram it is also evident that the dissociation pressure of
  the heptahydrate is higher than that of the decahydrate, although it
  contains less water of crystallization. The system
  heptahydrate&mdash;anhydrous salt&mdash;vapour must be metastable with
  respect to the system decahydrate&mdash;anhydrous salt&mdash;vapour, and
  will pass into the latter.<a name="NtA218"
  href="#Nt218"><sup>[218]</sup></a> Whether or not there is a temperature
  at which the vapour-pressure curves of the two systems intersect, and
  below which the heptahydrate becomes the more stable form, is not
  known.</p>

<p><!-- Page 142 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page142"></a>{142}</span></p>

  <p>In the case of sodium sulphate there is only one stable hydrate. Other
  salts are known which exhibit a similar behaviour; and we shall therefore
  expect that the solubility relationships will be represented by a diagram
  similar to that for sodium sulphate. A considerable number of such cases
  have, indeed, been found,<a name="NtA219"
  href="#Nt219"><sup>[219]</sup></a> and in some cases there is more than
  one metastable hydrate. This is found, for example, in the case of nickel
  iodate,<a name="NtA220" href="#Nt220"><sup>[220]</sup></a> the solubility
  curves for which are given in Fig. 35. As can be seen from the figure,
  suspended transformation occurs, the solubility curves having in some
  cases been followed to a considerable distance beyond the transition
  point. One of the most brilliant examples, however, of suspended
  transformation in the case of salt hydrates, and the sluggish transition
  from the less stable to the more stable form, is found in the case of the
  hydrates of calcium chromate.<a name="NtA221"
  href="#Nt221"><sup>[221]</sup></a></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:24%;">
      <a href="images/fig035.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig035.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 35" title="Fig. 35" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 35.
  </div>

  <p>In the preceding cases, the dissociation-pressure curve of the
  hydrated salt cuts the vapour-pressure curve of the saturated <!-- Page
  143 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page143"></a>{143}</span>solution
  of the anhydrous salt. It can, however, happen that the
  dissociation-pressure curve of one hydrate cuts the solubility curve, not
  of the anhydrous salt, but of a lower hydrate; in this case there will be
  more than one stable hydrate, each having a stable solubility curve; and
  these curves will intersect at the temperature of the transition point.
  Various examples of this behaviour are known, and we choose for
  illustration the solubility relationships of barium acetate and its
  hydrates<a name="NtA222" href="#Nt222"><sup>[222]</sup></a> (Fig.
  36).</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:50%;">
      <a href="images/fig036.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig036.png"
      alt="Fig. 36" title="Fig. 36" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 36.
  </div>

  <p>At temperatures above 0°, barium acetate can form two stable hydrates,
  a trihydrate and a monohydrate. The solubility of the trihydrate
  increases very rapidly with rise of temperature, and has been determined
  up to 26.1°. At temperatures above 24.7°, however, the trihydrate is
  metastable with respect to the monohydrate; for at this temperature the
  solubility curve of the latter hydrate cuts that of the former. This is,
  therefore, the transition temperature for the trihydrate and monohydrate.
  The solubility curve of the monohydrate succeeds that of the trihydrate,
  and exhibits a conspicuous point of minimum solubility at about 30°.
  Below 24.7° the <!-- Page 144 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page144"></a>{144}</span>monohydrate is the less stable hydrate,
  but its solubility has been determined to a temperature of 22°. At 41°
  the solubility curve of the monohydrate intersects that of the anhydrous
  salt, and this is therefore the transition temperature for the
  monohydrate and anhydrous salt. Above this temperature the anhydrous salt
  is the stable solid phase. Its solubility curve also passes through a
  minimum.</p>

  <p>The diagram of solubilities of barium acetate not only illustrates the
  way in which the solubility curves of the different stable hydrates of a
  salt succeed one another, but it has also an interest and importance from
  another point of view. In Fig. 36 there is also shown a faintly drawn
  curve which is continuous throughout its whole course. This curve
  represents the solubility of barium acetate as determined by Krasnicki.<a
  name="NtA223" href="#Nt223"><sup>[223]</sup></a> Since, however, three
  different solid phases can exist under the conditions of experiment, it
  is evident, from what has already been stated (p.&nbsp;<a
  href="#page111">111</a>), that the different equilibria between barium
  acetate and water could not be represented by one <i>continuous</i>
  curve.</p>

  <p>Another point which these experiments illustrate and which it is of
  the highest importance to bear in mind is, that in making determinations
  of the solubility of salts which are capable of forming hydrates, it is
  not only necessary to determine the composition of the solution, but
  <i>it is of equal importance to determine the composition of the solid
  phase in contact with it</i>. In view of the fact, also, that the
  solution equilibrium is in many cases established with comparative
  slowness, it is necessary to confirm the point of equilibrium, either by
  approaching it from higher as well as from lower temperatures, or by
  actually determining the rate with which the condition of equilibrium is
  attained. This can be accomplished by actual weighing of the dissolved
  salt or by determinations of the density of the solution, as well as by
  other methods.</p>

<p class="cenhead">2. <i>The Compounds formed have a Definite Melting Point.</i></p>

  <p>In the cases which have just been considered we saw that the salt
  hydrates on being heated did not undergo complete fusion, but that a
  solid was deposited consisting of a lower hydrate or of the anhydrous
  salt. It has, however, been long known that certain crystalline salt
  hydrates (<i>e.g.</i> sodium thiosulphate,
  Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,5H<sub>2</sub>O, sodium acetate,
  NaC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O) melt
  completely in their water of crystallization, and yield a liquid of the
  <i>same composition</i> as the crystalline salt. In the case of sodium
  thiosulphate pentahydrate the temperature of liquefaction is 56°; in the
  case of sodium acetate trihydrate, 58°. These two salts, therefore, have
  a definite melting point. For the purpose of studying the behaviour of
  such salt hydrates, we shall choose not the cases which have just been
  mentioned, but two others which have been more fully studied, viz. the
  hydrates of calcium chloride and of ferric chloride.</p>

  <p>So far as the first portion of the curve is concerned, it resembles
  the most general type of solubility curve. In the present case the
  solubility is so great and increases so rapidly with rise of temperature,
  that a point is reached at which the water of crystallization of the salt
  is sufficient for its complete solution. This temperature is 30.2°; and
  since the composition of the solution is the same as that of the solid
  salt, viz. 1 mol. of CaCl<sub>2</sub> to 6 mols. of water, this
  temperature must be the melting point of the hexahydrate. At this point
  the hydrate will fuse or the solution will solidify without change of
  temperature and without change of composition. Such a melting point is
  called a <i>congruent</i> melting point.</p>

  <p>But the solubility curve of calcium chloride hexahydrate differs
  markedly from the other solubility curves hitherto considered in that it
  possesses a <i>retroflex portion</i>, represented in the figure by BC. As
  is evident from the figure, therefore, calcium chloride hexahydrate
  exhibits the peculiar and, as it was at first thought, impossible
  behaviour that it can be in equilibrium at one and the same temperature
  with two different solutions, one of which contains more, the other less,
  water than the solid hydrate; for it must be remembered that <!-- Page
  147 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page147"></a>{147}</span>throughout
  the whole course of the curve ABC the solid phase present in equilibrium
  with the solution is the hexahydrate.</p>

  <p>Such a behaviour, however, on the part of calcium chloride hexahydrate
  will appear less strange if one reflects that the melting point of the
  hydrate will, like the melting point of other substances, be lowered by
  the addition of a second substance. If, therefore, water is added to the
  hydrate at its melting point, the temperature at which the solid hydrate
  will be in equilibrium with the liquid phase (solution) will be lowered;
  or if, on the other hand, anhydrous calcium chloride is added to the
  hydrate at its melting point (or what is the same thing, if water is
  removed from the solution), the temperature at which the hydrate will be
  in equilibrium with the liquid will also be lowered; <i>i.e.</i> the
  hydrate will melt at a lower temperature. In the former case we have the
  hydrate in equilibrium with a solution containing more water, in the
  latter case with a solution containing less water than is contained in
  the hydrate itself.</p>

  <p>It has already been stated (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page109">109</a>) that the
  solubility curve (in general, the equilibrium curve) is continuous so
  long as the solid phase remains unchanged; and we shall therefore expect
  that the curve ABC will be continuous. Formerly, however, it was
  considered by some that the curve was not continuous, but that the
  melting point is the point of intersection of two curves, a solubility
  curve and a fusion curve. Although the earlier solubility determinations
  were insufficient to decide this point conclusively, more recent
  investigation has proved beyond doubt that the curve is continuous and
  exhibits no break.<a name="NtA226" href="#Nt226"><sup>[226]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 148 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page148"></a>{148}</span></p>

  <p>Although in taking up the discussion of the equilibria between calcium
  chloride and water, it was desired especially to call attention to the
  form of the solubility curve in the case of salt hydrates possessing a
  definite melting point, nevertheless, for the sake of completeness, brief
  mention may be made of the other systems which these two components can
  form.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:43%;">
      <a href="images/fig038.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig038.png"

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 38.
  </div>

  <p>Besides the hexahydrate, the solubility curve of which has already
  been described, calcium chloride can also crystallize in two different
  forms, each of which contains four molecules <!-- Page 149 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page149"></a>{149}</span>of water of
  crystallization; these are distinguished as <span
  class="grk">&alpha;</span>-tetrahydrate, and <span
  class="grk">&beta;</span>-tetrahydrate. Two other hydrates are also
  known, viz. a dihydrate and a monohydrate. The solubility curves of these
  different hydrates are given in Fig. 38.</p>

  <p>On following the solubility curve of the hexahydrate from the ordinary
  temperature upwards, it is seen that at a temperature of 29.8°
  represented by the point H, it cuts the solubility curve of the <span
  class="grk">&alpha;</span>-tetrahydrate. This point is therefore a
  quadruple point at which the four phases hexahydrate, <span
  class="grk">&alpha;</span>-tetrahydrate, solution, and vapour can
  coexist. It is also the transition point for these two hydrates. Since,
  at temperatures above 29.8°, the <span
  class="grk">&alpha;</span>-tetrahydrate is the stable form, it is evident
  from the data given before (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page146">146</a>), as also from
  Fig. 38, that the portion of the solubility curve of the hexahydrate
  lying above this temperature represents <i>metastable</i> equilibria. The
  realization of the metastable melting point of the hexahydrate is,
  therefore, due to suspended transformation. At the transition point,
  29.8°, the solubility of the hexahydrate and <span
  class="grk">&alpha;</span>-tetrahydrate is 100.6 parts of
  CaCl<sub>2</sub> in 100 parts of water.</p>

  <p>The retroflex portion of the solubility curve of the hexahydrate
  extends to only 1° below the melting point of the hydrate. At 29.2°
  crystals of a new hydrate, <span class="grk">&beta;</span>-tetrahydrate,
  separate out, and the solution, which now contains 112.8 parts of
  CaCl<sub>2</sub> to 100 parts of water, is saturated with respect to the
  two hydrates. Throughout its whole extent the solubility curve EDF of the
  <span class="grk">&beta;</span>-tetrahydrate represents metastable
  equilibria. The upper limit of the solubility curve of <span
  class="grk">&beta;</span>-tetrahydrate is reached at 38.4° (F), the point
  of intersection with the curve for the dihydrate.</p>

  <p>Above 29.8° the stable hydrate is the <span
  class="grk">&alpha;</span>-tetrahydrate; and its solubility curve extends
  to 45.3° (K), at which temperature it cuts the solubility curve of the
  dihydrate. The curve of the latter hydrate extends to 175.5° (L), and is
  then succeeded by the curve for the monohydrate. The solubility curve of
  the anhydrous salt does not begin until a temperature of about 260°. The
  whole diagram, therefore, shows a succession of stable hydrates, a
  metastable hydrate, a metastable melting point and retroflex solubility
  curve. <!-- Page 150 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page150"></a>{150}</span></p>

  <p><b>Pressure-Temperature Diagram.</b>&mdash;The complete study of the
  equilibria between the two components calcium chloride and water would
  require the discussion of the vapour pressure of the different systems,
  and its variation with the temperature. For our present purpose, however,
  such a discussion would not be of great value, and will therefore be
  omitted here; in general, the same relationships would be found as in the
  case of sodium sulphate (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page138">138</a>), except that the
  rounded portion of the solubility curve of the hexahydrate would be
  represented by a similar rounded portion in the pressure curve.<a
  name="NtA227" href="#Nt227"><sup>[227]</sup></a> As in the case of sodium
  sulphate, the transition points of the different hydrates would be
  indicated by breaks in the curve of pressures. Finally, mention may again
  be made of the difference of the pressure of dissociation of the
  hexahydrate according as it becomes dehydrated to the <span
  class="grk">&alpha;</span>- or the <span
  class="grk">&beta;</span>-tetrahydrate (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page88">88</a>).</p>

  <p><b>The Indifferent Point.</b>&mdash;We have already seen that at 30.2°
  calcium chloride hexahydrate melts congruently, and that, provided the
  pressure is maintained constant, addition or withdrawal of heat will
  cause the complete liquefaction or solidification, without the
  temperature of the system undergoing change. This behaviour, therefore,
  is similar to, but is not quite the same as the fusion of a simple
  substance such as ice; and the difference is due to the fact that in the
  case of the hexahydrate the emission of vapour by the liquid phase causes
  an alteration in the composition of the latter, owing to the
  non-volatility of the calcium chloride; whereas in the case of ice this
  is, of course, not so.</p>

  <p>Consider, however, for the present that the vapour phase is absent,
  and that we are dealing with the two-phase system solid&mdash;solution.
  Then, since there are two components, the system is bivariant. For any
  given value of the pressure, therefore, we should expect that the system
  could exist at different temperatures; which, indeed, is the case. It
  has, however, already been noted that when the composition of the liquid
  phase becomes the same as that of the solid, the system then behaves as a
  <i>univariant</i> system; for, at a given pressure, the system
  solid&mdash;solution can exist only at <i>one</i> temperature, change of
  temperature producing complete transformation in <!-- Page 151 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page151"></a>{151}</span>one or other direction.
  <i>The variability of the system has therefore been diminished.</i></p>

  <p>This behaviour will perhaps be more clearly understood when one
  reflects that since the composition of the two phases is the same, the
  system may be regarded as being formed of <i>one component</i>, just as
  the system NH<sub>4</sub>Cl <a href="images/doublearrow.png"><img
  src="images/doublearrow.png" class="middle" style="height:2.5ex"
  alt="reversible arrow" /></a> NH<sub>3</sub> + HCl was regarded as being
  composed of one component when the vapour had the same total composition
  as the solid (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page13">13</a>). One component in two phases,
  however, constitutes a univariant system, and we can therefore see that
  calcium chloride hexahydrate in contact with solution of the same
  composition will constitute a univariant system. The temperature of
  equilibrium will, however, vary with the pressure;<a name="NtA228"
  href="#Nt228"><sup>[228]</sup></a> if the latter is constant, the
  temperature will also be constant.</p>

  <p>A point such as has just been referred to, which represents the
  special behaviour of a system of two (or more) components, in which the
  composition of two phases becomes identical, is known as an
  <i>indifferent point</i>,<a name="NtA229"
  href="#Nt229"><sup>[229]</sup></a> and it has been shown<a name="NtA230"
  href="#Nt230"><sup>[230]</sup></a> that at a given pressure the
  temperature in the indifferent point is the <i>maximum</i> or
  <i>minimum</i> temperature possible at the particular pressure<a
  name="NtA231" href="#Nt231"><sup>[231]</sup></a> (cf. critical solution
  temperature). At such a point a system loses one degree of freedom, or
  behaves like a system of the next lower order.</p>

  <p><b>The Hydrates of Ferric Chloride.</b>&mdash;A better illustration of
  the formation of compounds possessing a definite melting point, and of
  the existence of retroflex solubility curves, is afforded by the hydrates
  of ferric chloride, which not only possess definite points of fusion, but
  these melting points are stable. A very brief description of the
  relations met with will suffice.<a name="NtA232"
  href="#Nt232"><sup>[232]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 152 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page152"></a>{152}</span></p>

  <p>Ferric chloride can form no less than four stable hydrates, viz.
  Fe<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>,12H<sub>2</sub>O,
  Fe<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>,7H<sub>2</sub>O,
  Fe<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>,5H<sub>2</sub>O, and
  Fe<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>,4H<sub>2</sub>O, and each of these hydrates
  possesses a definite, stable melting point. On analogy with the behaviour
  of calcium chloride, therefore, we shall expect that the solubility
  curves of these different hydrates will exhibit a series of
  <i>temperature maxima</i>; the points of maximum temperature representing
  systems in which the composition of the solid and liquid phases is the
  same. A graphical representation of the solubility relations is given in
  Fig. 39, and the composition of the different saturated solutions which
  can be formed is given in the following tables, the composition being
  expressed in molecules of Fe<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub> to 100 molecules
  of water. The figures printed in thick type refer to transition and
  melting points.</p>

  <p>The lowest portion of the curve, AB, represents the equilibria between
  ice and solutions containing ferric chloride. It represents, in other
  words, the lowering of the fusion point of ice by addition of ferric
  chloride. At the point B (-55°), the cryohydric point (p.&nbsp;<a
  href="#page117">117</a>) is reached, at which the solution is in
  equilibrium with ice and ferric chloride dodecahydrate. As <!-- Page 154
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page154"></a>{154}</span>has already
  been shown, such a point represents an invariant system; and the liquid
  phase will, therefore, solidify to a mixture of ice and hydrate without
  change of temperature. If heat is added, ice will melt and the system
  will pass to the curve BCDN, which is the solubility curve of the
  dodecahydrate. At C (37°), the point of maximum temperature, the hydrate
  melts completely. The retroflex portion of this curve can be followed
  backwards to a temperature of 8°, but below 27.4° (D), the solutions are
  supersaturated with respect to the heptahydrate; point D is the eutectic
  point for dodecahydrate and heptahydrate. The curve DEF is the solubility
  curve of the heptahydrate, E being the melting point, 32.5°. On further
  increasing the quantity of ferric chloride, the temperature of
  equilibrium is lowered until at F (30°) another eutectic point is
  reached, at which the heptahydrate and pentahydrate can co-exist with
  solution. Then follow the solubility curves for the pentahydrate, the
  tetrahydrate, and the anhydrous salt; G (56°) is the melting point of the
  former hydrate, J (73.5°) the melting point of the latter. H and K, the
  points at which the curves intersect, represent eutectic points; the
  temperature of the former is 55°, that of the latter 66°. The dotted
  portions of the curves represent metastable equilibria.</p>

  <p>As is seen from the diagram, a remarkable series of solubility curves
  is obtained, each passing through a point of maximum temperature, the
  whole series of curves forming an undulating "festoon." To the right of
  the series of curves the diagram represents unsaturated solutions; to the
  left, supersaturated.</p>

  <p>If an unsaturated solution, the composition of which is represented by
  a point in the field to the right of the solubility curves, is cooled
  down, the result obtained will differ according as the composition of the
  solution is the same as that of a cryohydric point, or of a melting
  point, or has an intermediate value. Thus, if a solution represented by
  <i>x</i><sub>1</sub> is cooled down, the composition will remain
  unchanged as indicated by the horizontal dotted line, until the point D
  is reached. At this point, dodecahydrate and heptahydrate will separate
  out, and the liquid will ultimately solidify completely to a mixture or
  "conglomerate" of these two hydrates; the temperature of <!-- Page 155
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page155"></a>{155}</span>the system
  remaining constant until complete solidification has taken place. If, on
  the other hand, a solution of the composition <i>x</i><sub>3</sub> is
  cooled down, ferric chloride dodecahydrate will be formed when the
  temperature has fallen to that represented by C, and the solution will
  completely solidify, without alteration of temperature, with formation of
  this hydrate. In both these cases, therefore, a point is reached at which
  complete solidification occurs without change of temperature.</p>

  <p>Somewhat different, however, is the result when the solution has an
  intermediate composition, as represented by <i>x</i><sub>2</sub> or
  <i>x</i><sub>4</sub>. In the former case the dodecahydrate will first of
  all separate out, but on further withdrawal of heat the temperature will
  fall, the solution will become relatively richer in ferric chloride,
  owing to separation of the hydrate, and ultimately the eutectic point D
  will be reached, at which complete solidification will occur. Similarly
  with the second solution. Ferric chloride dodecahydrate will first be
  formed, and the temperature will gradually fall, the composition of the
  solution following the curve CB until the cryohydric point B is reached,
  when the whole will solidify to a conglomerate of ice and
  dodecahydrate.</p>

  <p><b>Suspended Transformation.</b>&mdash;Not only can the upper branch
  of the solubility curve of the dodecahydrate be followed backwards to a
  temperature of 8°, or about 19° below the temperature of transition to
  the heptahydrate; but suspended transformation has also been observed in
  the case of the heptahydrate and the pentahydrate. To such an extent is
  this the case that the solubility curve of the latter hydrate has been
  followed downwards to its point of intersection with the curve for the
  dodecahydrate. This point of intersection, represented in Fig. 39 by M,
  lies at a temperature of about 15°; and at this temperature, therefore,
  it is possible for the two solid phases dodecahydrate and pentahydrate to
  coexist, so that M is a eutectic point for the dodecahydrate and the
  pentahydrate. It is, however, a metastable eutectic point, for it lies in
  the region of supersaturation with respect to the heptahydrate; and it
  can be realized only because of the fact that the latter hydrate is not
  readily formed.</p>

  <p><b>Evaporation of Solutions at Constant Temperature.</b>&mdash;On <!--
  Page 156 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page156"></a>{156}</span>evaporating dilute solutions of ferric
  chloride at constant temperature, a remarkable series of changes is
  observed, which, however, will be understood with the help of Fig. 40.
  Suppose an unsaturated solution, the composition of which is represented
  by the point <i>x</i><sub>1</sub>, is evaporated at a temperature of
  about 17° - 18°. As water passes off, the composition of the solution
  will follow the dotted line of constant temperature, until at the point
  where it cuts the curve BC the solid hydrate
  Fe<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>,12H<sub>2</sub>O separates out. As water
  continues to be removed, the hydrate must be deposited (in order that the
  solution shall remain saturated), until finally the solution dries up to
  the hydrate. As dehydration proceeds, the heptahydrate can be formed, and
  the dodecahydrate will finally pass into the heptahydrate; and this, in
  turn, into the pentahydrate.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:24%;">
      <a href="images/fig040.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig040.png"
      alt="Fig. 40" title="Fig. 40" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 40.
  </div>

  <p>But the heptahydrate is not always formed by the dehydration of the
  dodecahydrate, and the behaviour on evaporation is therefore somewhat
  perplexing at first sight. After the solution has dried to the
  dodecahydrate, as explained above, further removal of water causes
  liquefaction, and the system is now represented by the point of
  intersection at <i>a</i>; at this point the solid hydrate is in
  equilibrium with a solution containing relatively more ferric chloride.
  If, therefore, evaporation is continued, the solid hydrate must <i>pass
  into solution</i> in order that the composition of the latter may remain
  unchanged, so that ultimately a liquid will again be obtained. A very
  slight further dehydration will bring the solution into the state
  represented by <i>b</i>, at which the pentahydrate is formed, and the
  solution will at last disappear and leave this hydrate alone.</p>

  <p>Without the information to be obtained from the curves in Figs. 39 and
  40, the phenomena which would be observed on carrying out the evaporation
  at a temperature of about 31 - 32° <!-- Page 157 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page157"></a>{157}</span>would be still more
  bewildering. The composition of the different solutions formed will be
  represented by the perpendicular line <i>x</i><sub>2</sub>12345.
  Evaporation will first cause the separation of the dodecahydrate, and
  then total disappearance of the liquid phase. Then liquefaction will
  occur, and the system will now be represented by the point 2, in which
  condition it will remain until the solid hydrate has disappeared.
  Following this there will be deposition of the heptahydrate (point 3),
  with subsequent disappearance of the liquid phase. Further dehydration
  will again cause liquefaction, when the concentration of the solution
  will be represented by the point 4; the heptahydrate will ultimately
  disappear, and then will ensue the deposition of the pentahydrate, and
  complete solidification will result. On evaporating a solution,
  therefore, of the composition <i>x</i><sub>2</sub>, the following series
  of phenomena will be observed: solidification to dodecahydrate;
  liquefaction; solidification to heptahydrate; liquefaction;
  solidification to pentahydrate.<a name="NtA233"
  href="#Nt233"><sup>[233]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Although ferric chloride and water form the largest and best-studied
  series of hydrates possessing definite melting points, examples of
  similar hydrates are not few in number; and more careful investigation is
  constantly adding to the list.<a name="NtA234"
  href="#Nt234"><sup>[234]</sup></a> In all these cases the solubility
  curve will show a point of maximum temperature, at which the hydrate
  melts, and will end, above and below, in a cryohydric point. Conversely,
  if such a curve is found in a system of two components, we can argue that
  a definite compound of the components possessing a definite melting point
  is formed.</p>

  <p><b>Inevaporable Solutions.</b>&mdash;If a saturated solution in
  contact with two hydrates, or with a hydrate and anhydrous salt is
  heated, the temperature and composition of the solution will, of course,
  remain unchanged so long as the two solid phases are present, for such a
  system is invariant. In addition to this, however, the <i>quantity</i> of
  the solution will also remain unchanged, the water which evaporates being
  supplied by the higher hydrate. The same phenomenon is also observed in
  the case of cryohydric points when ice is a solid phase; so long as the
  latter is present, evaporation will be accompanied <!-- Page 158 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page158"></a>{158}</span>by fusion of the ice,
  and the quantity of solution will remain constant. Such solutions are
  called <i>inevaporable</i>.<a name="NtA235"

  <p><b>Illustration.</b>&mdash;In order to illustrate the application of
  the principles of the Phase Rule to the study of systems formed by a
  volatile and a non-volatile component, a brief description may be given
  of the behaviour of sulphur dioxide and potassium iodide, which has
  formed the subject of a recent investigation. After it had been found<a
  name="NtA236" href="#Nt236"><sup>[236]</sup></a> that liquid sulphur
  dioxide has the property of dissolving potassium iodide, and that the
  solutions thus obtained present certain peculiarities of behaviour, the
  question arose as to whether or not compounds are formed between the
  sulphur dioxide and the potassium iodide, and if so, what these compounds
  are. To find an answer to this question, Walden and Centnerszwer<a
  name="NtA237" href="#Nt237"><sup>[237]</sup></a> made a complete
  investigation of the solubility curves (equilibrium curves) of these two
  components, the investigation extending from the freezing point to the
  critical point of sulphur dioxide. For convenience of reference, the
  results which they obtained are represented diagrammatically in Fig. 41.
  The freezing point (A) of pure sulphur dioxide was found to be -72.7°.
  Addition of potassium iodide lowered the freezing point, but the maximum
  depression obtained was very small, and was reached when the
  concentration of the potassium iodide in the solution was only 0.336
  mols. per cent. Beyond this point, an increase in the concentration of
  the iodide was accompanied by an elevation of the freezing point, the
  change of the freezing point with the concentration being represented by
  the curve BC. The solid <!-- Page 159 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page159"></a>{159}</span>which separated from the solutions
  represented by BC was a bright <i>yellow</i> crystalline substance. At
  the point C (-23.4°) a temperature-maximum was reached; and as the
  concentration of the potassium iodide was continuously increased, the
  temperature of equilibrium first fell and then slowly rose, until at
  +0.26° (E) a second temperature-maximum was registered. On passing the
  point D, the solid which was deposited from the solution was a <i>red</i>
  crystalline substance. On withdrawing sulphur dioxide from the system,
  the solution became turbid, and the temperature remained constant. The
  investigation was not pursued farther at this point, the attention being
  then directed to the equilibria at higher temperatures.</p>

  <p>When a solution of potassium iodide in liquid sulphur dioxide
  containing 1.49 per cent. of potassium iodide was heated, solid
  (potassium iodide) was deposited at a temperature of 96.4°. Solutions
  containing more than about 3 per cent. of the iodide separated, on being
  heated, into two layers, and the temperature at which the liquid became
  heterogeneous fell as the concentration was increased; a
  temperature-minimum being obtained with solutions containing 12 per cent.
  of potassium iodide. On the other hand, solutions containing 30.9 per
  cent. of the iodide, on being heated, deposited potassium iodide; while a
  solution containing 24.5 per cent. of the salt first separated into two
  layers at 89.3°, and then, on cooling, solid was deposited and one of the
  liquid layers disappeared.</p>

  <p>Such are, in brief, the results of experiment; their interpretation in
  the light of the Phase Rule is the following:&mdash;</p>

  <p>The curve AB is the freezing-point curve of solid sulphur dioxide in
  contact with solutions of potassium iodide. BCD is the solubility curve
  of the yellow crystalline solid which is deposited from the solutions. C,
  the temperature-maximum, is the melting point of this <i>yellow</i>
  solid, and the composition of the latter must be the same as that of the
  solution at this point (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page145">145</a>), which was found
  to be that represented by the formula KI,14SO<sub>2</sub>. B is therefore
  the eutectic point, at which solid sulphur dioxide and the compound
  KI,14SO<sub>2</sub> can exist together in equilibrium with solution and
  vapour. The curve DE is the solubility curve of the <i>red</i>
  crystalline solid, and the <!-- Page 160 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page160"></a>{160}</span>point E, at which the composition of
  solution and solid is the same, is the melting point of the solid. The
  composition of this substance was found to be KI,4SO<sub>2</sub>.<a
  name="NtA238" href="#Nt238"><sup>[238]</sup></a> D is, therefore, the
  eutectic point at which the compounds KI,14SO<sub>2</sub> and
  KI,4SO<sub>2</sub> can coexist in equilibrium with solution and vapour.
  The curve DE does not exhibit a retroflex portion; on the contrary, on
  attempting to obtain more concentrated solutions in equilibrium with the
  compound KI,4SO<sub>2</sub>, a new solid phase (probably potassium
  iodide) was formed. Since at this point there are four phases in
  equilibrium, viz. the compound KI,4SO<sub>2</sub>, potassium iodide,
  solution, and vapour, the system is invariant. E is, therefore, the
  <i>transition point</i> for KI,4SO<sub>2</sub> and KI.</p>

  <p>Passing to higher temperatures, FG is the solubility curve of
  potassium iodide in sulphur dioxide; at G two liquid phases are formed,
  and the system therefore becomes invariant (cf. p.&nbsp;<a
  href="#page121">121</a>). The curve GHK is the solubility curve for two
  partially miscible liquids; and since complete miscibility occurs on
  <i>lowering</i> the temperature, the curve is similar to that obtained
  with triethylamine and water (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page101">101</a>). K is also
  an invariant point at which potassium iodide is in equilibrium with two
  liquid phases and vapour.</p>

  <p>The complete investigation of the equilibria between sulphur dioxide
  and potassium iodide, therefore, shows that these two components form the
  compounds KI,14SO<sub>2</sub> and KI,4SO<sub>2</sub>; and that when
  solutions having a concentration between those represented by the points
  G and K are heated, separation into two layers occurs. The temperatures
  and concentrations of the different characteristic points are as
  follows:&mdash;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>

<p class="cenhead">EQUILIBRIA BETWEEN TWO VOLATILE COMPONENTS</p>

  <p><b>General.</b>&mdash;In the two preceding chapters certain
  restrictions were imposed on the discussion of the equilibria between two
  components; but in the present chapter the restriction that only one of
  the components is volatile will be allowed to fall, and the general
  behaviour of two volatile<a name="NtA239"
  href="#Nt239"><sup>[239]</sup></a> components, each of which is capable
  of forming a liquid solution with the other, will be studied. As we shall
  see, however, the removal of the previous restriction produces no
  alteration in the general aspect of the equilibrium curves for
  concentration and temperature, but changes to some extent the appearance
  of the pressure-temperature diagram. The latter would become still more
  complicated if account were taken not only of the total pressure but also
  of the partial pressures of the two components in the vapour phase; this
  complication, however, will not be introduced in the present
  discussion.<a name="NtA240" href="#Nt240"><sup>[240]</sup></a> In this
  chapter we shall consider the systems formed by the two components iodine
  and chlorine, and sulphur dioxide and water.</p>

  <p><b>Iodine and Chlorine.</b>&mdash;The different systems furnished by
  iodine and chlorine, rendered classical by the studies of Stortenbeker,<a
  name="NtA241" href="#Nt241"><sup>[241]</sup></a> form a very complete
  example of equilibria in a two-component system. We shall first of all
  consider the <!-- Page 162 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page162"></a>{162}</span>relations between concentration and
  temperature, with the help of the accompanying diagram, Fig. 42.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:33%;">
      <a href="images/fig042.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig042.png"
      alt="Fig. 42" title="Fig. 42" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 42.</span>
  </div>

  <p><b>Concentration-Temperature Diagram.</b>&mdash;In this diagram the
  temperatures are taken as the abscissæ, and the composition of the
  solution, expressed in atoms of chlorine to one atom of iodine,<a
  name="NtA242" href="#Nt242"><sup>[242]</sup></a> is represented by the
  ordinates. In the diagram, A represents the melting point of pure iodine,
  114°. If chlorine is added to the system, a solution of chlorine in
  liquid iodine is obtained, and the temperature at which solid iodine is
  in equilibrium with the liquid solution will be all the lower the greater
  the concentration of the chlorine. We therefore obtain the curve ABF,
  which represents the composition of the solution <!-- Page 163 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page163"></a>{163}</span>with which solid iodine
  is in equilibrium at different temperatures. This curve can be followed
  down to 0°, but at temperatures below 7.9° (B) it represents metastable
  equilibria. At B iodine monochloride can be formed, and if present the
  system becomes invariant; B is therefore a quadruple point at which the
  four phases, iodine, iodine monochloride, solution, and vapour, can
  coexist. Continued withdrawal of heat at this point will therefore lead
  to the complete solidification of the solution to a mixture or
  conglomerate of iodine and iodine monochloride, while the temperature
  remains constant during the process. B is the eutectic point for iodine
  and iodine monochloride.</p>

  <p>Just as we found in the case of aqueous salt solutions that at
  temperatures above the cryohydric or eutectic point, two different
  solutions could exist, one in equilibrium with ice, the other in
  equilibrium with the salt (or salt hydrate), so in the case of iodine and
  chlorine there can be two solutions above the eutectic point B, one
  containing a lower proportion of chlorine in equilibrium with iodine, the
  other containing a higher proportion of chlorine in equilibrium with
  iodine monochloride. The composition of the latter solution is
  represented by the curve BCD. As the concentration of chlorine is
  increased, the temperature at which there is equilibrium between iodine
  monochloride and solution rises until a point is reached at which the
  composition of the solution is the same as that of the solid. At this
  point (C), iodine monochloride melts. Addition of one of the components
  will lower the temperature of fusion, and a continuous curve,<a
  name="NtA243" href="#Nt243"><sup>[243]</sup></a> exhibiting a retroflex
  portion as in the case of CaCl<sub>2</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O, will be
  obtained. At temperatures below its melting point, therefore, iodine
  monochloride can be in equilibrium with two different solutions.</p>

  <p>The upper portion of this curve, CD, can be followed downwards to a
  temperature of 22.7°. At this temperature iodine trichloride can separate
  out, and a second quadruple <!-- Page 164 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page164"></a>{164}</span>point (D) is obtained. This is the
  eutectic point for iodine monochloride and iodine trichloride.</p>

  <p>By addition of heat and increase in the amount of chlorine, the iodine
  monochloride disappears, and the system passes along the curve DE, which
  represents the composition of the solutions in equilibrium with solid
  iodine trichloride. The concentration of chlorine in the solution
  increases as the temperature is raised, until at the point E, where the
  solution has the same composition as the solid, the maximum temperature
  is reached; the iodine trichloride melts. On increasing still further the
  concentration of chlorine in the solution, the temperature of equilibrium
  falls, and a continuous curve, similar to that for the monochloride, is
  obtained. The upper branch of this curve has been followed down to a
  temperature of 30°, the solution at this point containing 99.6 per cent.
  of chlorine.<a name="NtA244" href="#Nt244"><sup>[244]</sup></a> The very
  rounded form of the curve is due to the trichloride being largely
  dissociated in the liquid state.</p>

  <p>One curve still remains to be considered. As has already been
  mentioned, iodine monochloride can exist in two crystalline forms, only
  one of which, however, is stable at temperatures below the melting point;
  the two forms are <i>monotropic</i> (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page44">44</a>). The
  stable form which melts at 27.2°, is called the <span
  class="grk">&alpha;</span>-form, while the less stable variety, melting
  at 13.9°, is known as the <span class="grk">&beta;</span>-form. If, now,
  the presence of <span class="grk">&alpha;</span>-ICl is excluded, it is
  possible to obtain the <span class="grk">&beta;</span>-form, and to study
  the conditions of equilibrium between it and solutions of iodine and
  chlorine, from the eutectic point F to the melting point G. As the <span
  class="grk">&beta;</span>-ICl becomes less stable in presence of excess
  of chlorine, it has not been possible to study the retroflex portion of
  the curve represented by the dotted continuation of FG.</p>

  <p>The following table gives some of the numerical data from which Fig.
  42 was constructed.<a name="NtA245"

  <p>Since the vapour pressure at the melting point of iodine trichloride
  amounts to 16 atm., the experiments must of course be carried out in
  closed vessels. At 63.7° the vapour pressure of the system
  trichloride&mdash;solution&mdash;vapour is equal to 1 atm.</p>

  <p><b>Pressure-Temperature Diagram.</b>&mdash;In this diagram there are
  represented the values of the vapour pressure of the saturated solutions
  of chlorine and iodine. To give a complete picture of the relations
  between pressure, temperature, and concentration, a solid model would be
  required, with three axes at right angles to one another along which
  could be measured the values of pressure, temperature, and concentration
  of the components in the solution. Instead of this, however, there may be
  employed the accompanying projection figure<a name="NtA247"
  href="#Nt247"><sup>[247]</sup></a> (Fig. 43), the lower portion of which
  shows the projection of the equilibrium curve on the surface containing
  the concentration and temperature axes, while the upper portion is the
  projection on the plane containing the pressure and temperature axes. The
  lower portion is therefore a concentration-temperature diagram; <!-- Page

  portion, a pressure-temperature diagram. The corresponding points of the
  two diagrams are joined by dotted lines.</p>

  <p>Corresponding to the point C, the melting point of pure iodine, there
  is the point <span class="correction" title="Original reads C'."
  >C<sub>1</sub></span>, which represents the vapour pressure of iodine at
  its melting point. At this point three curves cut: 1, the sublimation
  curve of iodine; 2, the vaporization curve of fused iodine; 3,
  C<sub>1</sub>B<sub>1</sub>, the vapour-pressure curve of the saturated
  solutions in equilibrium with solid iodine. Starting, therefore, with the
  system solid iodine&mdash;liquid iodine, addition of chlorine will cause
  the temperature of equilibrium to fall continuously, while the vapour
  pressure will first increase, pass through a maximum and then fall
  continuously <!-- Page 167 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  (B<sub>1</sub>), is reached.<a name="NtA248"
  href="#Nt248"><sup>[248]</sup></a> At this point the system is invariant,
  and the pressure will therefore remain constant until all the iodine has
  disappeared. As the concentration of the chlorine increases in the manner
  represented by the curve B<i>f</i>H, the pressure of the vapour also
  increases as represented by the curve
  B<sub>1</sub><i>f</i><sub>1</sub>H<sub>1</sub>. At H<sub>1</sub>, the
  eutectic point for iodine monochloride and iodine trichloride, the
  pressure again remains constant until all the monochloride has
  disappeared. As the concentration of the solution passes along the curve
  HF, the pressure of the vapour increases as represented by the curve
  H<sub>1</sub>F<sub>1</sub>; F<sub>1</sub> represents the pressure of the
  vapour at the melting point of iodine trichloride. If the concentration
  of the chlorine in the solution is continuously increased from this
  point, the vapour pressure first increases and then decreases, until the
  eutectic point for iodine trichloride and solid chlorine is reached
  (D<sub>1</sub>). Curves Cl<sub>2</sub> solid and Cl<sub>2</sub> liquid
  represent the sublimation and vaporization curves of chlorine, the
  melting point of chlorine being -102°.</p>

  <p>Although complete measurements of the vapour pressure of the different
  systems of pure iodine to pure chlorine have not been made, the
  experimental data are nevertheless sufficient to allow of the general
  form of the curves being indicated with certainty.</p>

  <p><b>Bivariant Systems.</b>&mdash;To these, only a brief reference need
  be made. Since there are two components, two phases will form a bivariant

  <p>The conditions for the existence of these systems will probably be
  best understood from Fig. 44. Since the curve B&prime;A&prime; <!-- Page
  168 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page168"></a>{168}</span>represents
  the pressures under which the system iodine&mdash;solution&mdash;vapour
  can exist, increase of volume (diminution of pressure) will cause the
  volatilization of the solution, and the system iodine&mdash;vapour will
  remain. If, therefore, we start with a system represented by <i>a</i>,
  diminution of pressure at constant temperature will lead to the condition
  represented by <i>x</i>. On the other hand, increase of pressure at
  <i>a</i> will lead to the condensation of a portion of the vapour phase.
  Since, now, the concentration of chlorine in the vapour is greater than
  in the solution, condensation of vapour would increase the concentration
  of chlorine in the solution; a certain amount of iodine must therefore
  pass into solution in order that the composition of the latter shall
  remain unchanged.<a name="NtA249" href="#Nt249"><sup>[249]</sup></a> If,
  therefore, the volume of vapour be sufficiently great, continued
  diminution of volume will ultimately lead to the disappearance of all the
  iodine, and there will remain only solution and vapour (field II.). As
  the diminution of volume is continued, the vapour pressure and the
  concentration of the chlorine in the solution will increase, until when
  the pressure has reached the value <i>b</i>, iodine monochloride can
  separate out. The system, therefore, again becomes univariant, and at
  constant temperature the pressure and composition of the phases must
  remain unchanged. Diminution of volume will therefore not effect an
  increase of pressure, but a condensation of the vapour; and since this is
  richer in chlorine than the <!-- Page 169 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page169"></a>{169}</span>solution, solid iodine monochloride must
  separate out in order that the concentration of the solution remain
  unchanged.<a name="NtA250" href="#Nt250"><sup>[250]</sup></a> As the
  result, therefore, we obtain the bivariant system iodine
  monochloride&mdash;vapour.</p>

  <p>A detailed discussion of the effect of a continued increase of
  pressure will not be necessary. From what has already been said and with
  the help of Fig. 44, it will readily be understood that this will lead
  successively to the univariant system (<i>c</i>), iodine
  monochloride&mdash;solution&mdash;vapour; the bivariant system
  solution&mdash;vapour (field II.); the univariant system (<i>d</i>),
  iodine trichloride&mdash;solution&mdash;vapour; and the bivariant system
  <i>x&prime;</i>, iodine trichloride&mdash;vapour. If the temperature of
  the experiment is above the melting point of the monochloride, then the
  systems in which this compound occurs will not be formed.</p>

  <p><b>Sulphur Dioxide and Water.</b>&mdash;In the case just studied we
  have seen that the components can combine to form definite compounds
  possessing stable melting points. The curves of equilibrium, therefore,
  resemble in their general aspect those of calcium chloride and water, or
  of ferric chloride and water. In the case of sulphur dioxide and water,
  however, the melting point of the compound formed cannot be realized,
  because transition to another system occurs; retroflex
  concentration-temperature curves are therefore not found here, but the
  curves exhibit breaks or sudden changes in direction at the transition
  points, as in the case of the systems formed by sodium sulphate and
  water. The case of sulphur dioxide and water is also of interest from the
  fact that two liquid phases can be formed.</p>

  <p>The phases which occur are&mdash;Solid: ice, sulphur dioxide hydrate,
  SO<sub>2</sub>,7H<sub>2</sub>O. Liquid: two solutions, the one containing
  excess of sulphur dioxide, the other excess of water, and represented by
  the symbols SO<sub>2</sub> <a href="images/wavy.png"><img

  href="images/wavy.png"><img src="images/wavy.png" class="middle"
  style="height:1.5ex" alt="wavy" /></a> <i>y</i>SO<sub>2</sub> (solution
  II.). Vapour: a mixture of sulphur dioxide and water vapour in varying
  proportions. Since there are two components, sulphur dioxide and water,
  the number of <!-- Page 170 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  following, however, have been studied:&mdash;</p>

  <p><b>Pressure-Temperature Diagram.</b><a name="NtA251"
  href="#Nt251"><sup>[251]</sup></a>&mdash;If sulphur dioxide is passed
  into water at 0°, a solution will be formed and the temperature at which
  ice can exist in equilibrium with this solution will fall more and more
  as the concentration of the sulphur dioxide increases. At -2.6°, however,
  a cryohydric point is reached at which solid hydrate separates out, and
  the system becomes invariant. The curve AB (Fig. 45) therefore represents
  the pressure of the system ice&mdash;solution II.&mdash;vapour, and B
  represents the temperature and pressure at which the invariant system
  ice&mdash;hydrate&mdash;solution II.&mdash;vapour can exist. At this
  point the temperature is -2.6°, and the pressure 21.1 cm. If heat is
  withdrawn from this system, the solution will ultimately <!-- Page 171
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page171"></a>{171}</span>solidify to a
  mixture of ice and hydrate, and there will be obtained the univariant
  system ice&mdash;hydrate&mdash;vapour. The vapour pressure of this system
  has been determined down to a temperature of -9.5°, at which temperature
  the pressure amounts to 15 cm. The pressures for this system are
  represented by the curve BC. If at the point B the volume is diminished,
  the pressure must remain constant, but the relative amounts of the
  different phases will undergo change. If suitable quantities of these are
  present, diminution of volume will ultimately lead to the total
  condensation of the vapour phase, and there will remain the univariant
  system ice&mdash;hydrate&mdash;solution. The temperature of equilibrium
  of this system will alter with the pressure, but, as in the case of the
  melting point of a simple substance, great differences of pressure will
  cause only comparatively small changes in the temperature of equilibrium.
  The change of the cryohydric point with the pressure is represented by
  the line BE; the actual values have not been determined, but the curve
  must slope towards the pressure axis because fusion is accompanied by
  diminution of volume, as in the case of pure ice. <!-- Page 172 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page172"></a>{172}</span></p>

  <p>A fourth univariant system can be formed at B. This is the system
  hydrate&mdash;solution II.&mdash;vapour. The conditions for the existence
  of this system are represented by the curve BF, which may therefore be
  regarded as the vapour-pressure curve of the saturated solution of
  sulphur dioxide heptahydrate in water. Unlike the curve for iodine
  trichloride&mdash;solution&mdash;vapour, this curve cannot be followed to
  the melting point of the hydrate. Before this point is reached, a second
  liquid phase appears, and an invariant system consisting of
  hydrate&mdash;solution I.&mdash;solution II.&mdash;vapour is formed. We
  have here, therefore, the phenomenon of melting under the solution as in
  the case of succinic nitrile and water (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page122">122</a>).
  This point is represented in the diagram by F; the temperature at this
  point is 12.1°, and the pressure 177.3 cm. The range of stable existence
  of the hydrate is therefore from -2.6° to 12.1°; nevertheless, the curve
  FB has been followed down to a temperature of -6°, at which point ice
  formed spontaneously.</p>

  <p>So long as the four phases hydrate, two liquid phases, and vapour are
  present, the condition of the system is perfectly defined. By altering
  the conditions, however, one of the phases can be made to disappear, and
  a univariant system will then be obtained. Thus, if the vapour phase is
  made to disappear, the univariant system solution I.&mdash;solution
  II.&mdash;hydrate, will be left, and the temperature at which this system
  is in equilibrium will vary with the pressure. This is represented by the
  curve FI; under a pressure of 225 atm. the temperature of equilibrium is
  17.1°. Increase of pressure, therefore, raises the temperature at which
  the three phases can coexist.</p>

  <p>Again, addition of heat to the invariant system at F will cause the
  disappearance of the solid phase, and there will be formed the univariant
  system solution I.&mdash;solution II.&mdash;vapour. In the case of this
  system the vapour pressure increases as the temperature rises, as
  represented by the curve FG. Such a system is analogous to the case of
  ether and water, or other two partially miscible liquids (p.&nbsp;<a
  href="#page103">103</a>). As the temperature changes, the composition of
  the two liquid phases will undergo change; but this system has not been
  studied fully.</p>

  <p>The fourth curve, which ends at the quadruple point F, is <!-- Page
  173 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page173"></a>{173}</span>that
  representing the vapour pressure of the system hydrate&mdash;solution
  I.&mdash;vapour (FH). This curve has been followed to a temperature of
  0°, the pressure at this point being 113 cm. The metastable prolongation
  of GF has also been determined. Although, theoretically, this curve must
  lie below FH, it was found that the difference in the pressure for the
  two curves was within the error of experiment.</p>

  <p><b>Bivariant Systems.</b>&mdash;The different bivariant systems,
  consisting of two phases, which can exist within the range of temperature
  and pressure included in Fig. 45, were given on p.&nbsp;<a
  href="#page170">170</a>. The conditions under which these systems can
  exist are represented by the areas in the diagram, and the fields of the
  different bivariant systems are indicated by letters, corresponding to
  the letters on p.&nbsp;<a href="#page170">170</a>. Just as in the case of
  one-component systems (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page29">29</a>), we found that the
  field lying between any two curves gave the conditions of existence of
  that phase which was common to the two curves, so also in the case of
  two-component systems, a bivariant two-phase system occurs in the field
  enclosed<a name="NtA252" href="#Nt252"><sup>[252]</sup></a> by the two
  curves to which the two phases are common. As can be seen, the same
  bivariant system can occur in more than one field.</p>

  <p>As is evident from Fig. 45, three different bivariant systems are
  capable of existing in the area HFI; which of these will be obtained will
  depend on the relative masses of the different phases in the univariant
  or invariant system. Thus, starting with a system represented by a point
  on the curve HF, diminution of volume at constant temperature will cause
  the condensation of a portion of the vapour, which is rich in sulphur
  dioxide; since this would increase the concentration of sulphur dioxide
  in the solution, it must be counteracted by the passage of a portion of
  the hydrate (which is relatively poor in sulphur dioxide) into the
  solution. If, therefore, the amount of hydrate present is relatively very
  small, the final result of the compression will be the production of the
  system <i>f</i>, solution I.&mdash;vapour. On the other hand, if the
  vapour is present in relatively small amount, it will be the first phase
  to disappear, <!-- Page 174 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page174"></a>{174}</span>and the bivariant system <i>a</i>,
  hydrate&mdash;solution I., will be obtained. Finally, if we start with
  the invariant system at F, compression will cause the condensation of
  vapour, while the composition of the two solutions will remain unchanged.
  When all the vapour has disappeared, the univariant system
  hydrate&mdash;solution I.&mdash;solution II. will be left. If, now, the
  pressure is still further increased, while the temperature is kept below
  12°, more and more hydrate must be formed at the expense of the two
  liquid phases (because 12° is the lower limit for the coexistence of the
  two liquid phases), and if the amount of the solution I. (containing
  excess of sulphur dioxide) is relatively small, it will disappear before
  solution II., and there will be obtained the bivariant system
  hydrate&mdash;solution II. (bivariant system <i>b</i>).</p>

  <p>In a similar manner, account can be taken of the formation of the
  other bivariant systems.</p>

  <p>A behaviour similar to that of sulphur dioxide and water is shown by
  chlorine and water and by bromine and water, although these have not been
  so fully studied.<a name="NtA253" href="#Nt253"><sup>[253]</sup></a> In
  the case of hydrogen bromide and water, and of hydrogen chloride and
  water, a hydrate, viz. HBr,2H<sub>2</sub>O and HCl,2H<sub>2</sub>O, is
  formed which possesses a definite melting point, as in the case of iodine
  trichloride. In these cases, therefore, a retroflex curve is obtained.
  Further, just as in the case of the chlorides of iodine the upper branch
  of the retroflex curve ended in a eutectic point, so also in the case of
  the hydrate HBr,2H<sub>2</sub>O the upper branch of the curve ends in a
  eutectic point at which the system
  dihydrate&mdash;monohydrate&mdash;solution&mdash;vapour can exist. Before
  the melting point of the monohydrate is reached, two liquid phases are
  formed, as in the case of sulphur dioxide and water.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X</h3>

<p class="cenhead">SOLID SOLUTIONS. MIXED CRYSTALS</p>

  <p><b>General.</b>&mdash;With the conception of gaseous and liquid
  solutions, every one is familiar. Gases can mix in all proportions to
  form homogeneous solutions. Gases can dissolve in or be "absorbed" by
  liquids; and solids, also, when brought in contact with liquids, "pass
  into solution" and yield a homogeneous liquid phase. On the other hand,
  the conception of a <i>solid solution</i> is one which in many cases is
  found more difficult to appreciate; and the existence and behaviour of
  solid solutions, in spite of their not uncommon occurrence and
  importance, are in general comparatively little known.</p>

  <p>The reason of this is to be found, to some extent, no doubt, in the
  fact that the term "solid solution" was introduced at a comparatively
  recent date,<a name="NtA254" href="#Nt254"><sup>[254]</sup></a> but it is
  probably also due in some measure to a somewhat hazy comprehension of the
  definition of the term "solution" itself. As has already been said (p.&nbsp;<a
  href="#page92">92</a>), a solution is a homogeneous phase, the
  composition of which can vary continuously within certain limits; the
  definition involves, therefore, no condition as to the physical state of
  the substances. Accordingly, solid solutions are homogeneous solid
  phases, the composition of which can undergo continuous variation within
  certain limits. Just as we saw that the range of variation of composition
  is more limited in the case of liquids than in the case of gases, so also
  we find that the limits of miscibility are in general still more
  restricted in the case of solids. Examples of complete miscibility are,
  however, not unknown even in the case of solid substances.</p>

  <p>Solid solutions have long been known, although, of course, <!-- Page
  176 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page176"></a>{176}</span>they were
  not defined as such. Thus, the phenomena of "occlusion" of gases by
  metals and other substances (occlusion of hydrogen by palladium;
  occlusion of hydrogen by iron) are due to the formation of solid
  solutions. The same is probably also true of the phenomena of
  "adsorption," as in the removal of organic colouring matter by charcoal,
  although, in this case, surface tension no doubt plays a considerable
  part.<a name="NtA255" href="#Nt255"><sup>[255]</sup></a></p>

  <p>As examples of the solution of gases in solids there may be cited (in
  addition to the phenomena of occlusion already mentioned), the hydrated
  silicates and the zeolites. During dehydration these crystalline
  substances remain clear and transparent, and the pressure of the water
  vapour which they emit varies with the degree of hydration or the
  concentration of water in the mineral.<a name="NtA256"
  href="#Nt256"><sup>[256]</sup></a> As examples of the solution of solids
  in solids we have the cementation of iron by charcoal, the formation of
  glass, and the crystallization together of isomorphous substances.</p>

  <p>Although we have here spoken of the glasses as "solid solutions," it
  should be mentioned that the term "solid" is used in its popular sense.
  Strictly speaking, the glasses are to be regarded as supercooled liquids
  (see also p. 53, <a href="#Nt96">footnote</a>).</p>

  <p>In discussing the equilibria in systems containing a solid solution,
  it is of essential importance to remember that a solid solution
  constitutes only <i>one</i> phase, a phase of varying composition, as in
  the case of liquid solutions.</p>

  <p><b>Solution of Gases in Solids.</b>&mdash;Comparatively little work
  has been done in this connection, the investigations being limited
  chiefly to the phenomena of occlusion or adsorption of gases by
  charcoal.<a name="NtA257" href="#Nt257"><sup>[257]</sup></a> We shall,
  therefore, indicate only briefly <!-- Page 177 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page177"></a>{177}</span>and in a general
  manner, the behaviour which the Phase Rule enables us to foresee.<a
  name="NtA258" href="#Nt258"><sup>[258]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In dealing with the systems formed by the two phases gas&mdash;solid,
  three chief cases call for mention:&mdash;</p>

  <p>I. <i>The gas is not absorbed by the solid, but when the pressure
  reaches a certain value, combination of the two components can
  result.</i></p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:19%;">
      <a href="images/fig046.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig046.png"
      alt="Fig. 46" title="Fig. 46" /></a>
    Fig. 46.
  </div>

  <p>The graphic representation of such a system is shown in Fig. 46, the
  ordinates being the pressures of the gas, and the abscissæ the
  concentrations of the gaseous component in the solid phase. Since there
  is no formation of a solid solution, the concentration of gas in the
  solid phase remains zero until the pressure has increased to the point A.
  At this point combination can take place. There will now be three phases
  present, viz. solid component, compound, and vapour. The system is
  therefore univariant, and if the temperature is maintained constant, the
  vapour pressure will be constant, irrespective of the amount of compound
  formed, <i>i.e.</i> irrespective of the relative amounts of gas and
  solid. This is indicated by the line AB. When the solid component has
  entirely disappeared, the system ceases to be univariant, and if no
  absorption occurs, the pressure will increase again, as shown by BC. If a
  second compound can be formed, then a second <i>pc</i>-line will be
  obtained, similar to the preceding. To this group belong the salt
  hydrates (Chap. VII.).</p>

  <p>II. <i>The gas may be absorbed and may also form a compound.</i></p>

  <p>If absorption of gas occurs with formation of a solid solution, then,
  as the system consists of two phases, solution&mdash;vapour, it is
  bivariant. At constant temperature, therefore, the pressure will still
  vary with the concentration of the gaseous component in the solid phase.
  This is represented by the curve AB in Fig. 47. When, however, the
  pressure has reached a certain value, combination can take place; and
  since there are now three phases present, the system is <!-- Page 178
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page178"></a>{178}</span>univariant,
  and at constant temperature the pressure is constant, as shown by the
  line BC.</p>

  <p>III. <i>Absorption of gas occurs, but at a certain concentration the
  solid solution can separate into two immiscible solid solutions.</i></p>

  <p>We have seen, in Chapter VI., that two liquids can form two immiscible
  solutions, and the same has also been found true of solid solutions, as
  we shall presently learn more fully. If, now, two immiscible solutions
  are formed, then the system will become univariant, and at constant
  temperature the <i>pc</i>-curve will be a straight line, as in the case
  of the formation of a compound (cf. p.&nbsp;<a href="#page86">86</a>). The
  behaviour of this system will, therefore, also be represented
  diagrammatically by Fig. 47.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:16%;">
      <a href="images/fig047.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig047.png"

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 47.
  </div>

  <p><i>Palladium and Hydrogen.</i>&mdash;The phenomenon of the absorption
  of hydrogen by palladium, to which Graham gave the name "occlusion," is
  one that has claimed the attention of several investigators. Although
  Graham was not of opinion that a compound is formed, but rather that the
  gas undergoes very great condensation, acts as a quasi-metal (to which he
  gave the name hydrogenium), and forms a homogeneous alloy with the
  palladium, later investigations, especially those of Troost and
  Hautefeuille,<a name="NtA259" href="#Nt259"><sup>[259]</sup></a> pointed
  to the formation of a definite chemical compound, having the formula
  Pd<sub>2</sub>H. This conclusion has, however, not been confirmed by
  subsequent investigation.<a name="NtA260"
  href="#Nt260"><sup>[260]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Roozeboom and Hoitsema<a name="NtA261"
  href="#Nt261"><sup>[261]</sup></a> sought to arrive at a final decision
  as to the nature of the phenomenon by an investigation of the equilibrium
  between hydrogen and palladium on the basis of the Phase Rule
  classification given above. If a compound is formed, diminution of volume
  would cause no increase of pressure, but only an increase in the amount
  of the compound.</p>

  <p>As this is the only case of gas absorption which has been <!-- Page
  179 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page179"></a>{179}</span>accurately
  studied from this point of view, a brief account of the results obtained
  will be given here, although these are not so clear and free from
  ambiguity as one would desire.</p>

  <p>The scientists just mentioned investigated the variation of the
  pressure of hydrogen with the amount absorbed by the metal at different
  temperatures, and a few of their results, typical of all, are represented
  graphically in Fig. 48; the curves indicating the variation of the gas
  pressure with the concentration of the hydrogen in the palladium at the
  temperatures 120°, 170°, and 200°. As can be seen, the curve consists of
  three parts, an ascending portion which passes gradually and continuously
  into an almost horizontal but slightly ascending middle part, which in
  turn passes without break into a second rapidly ascending curve. This, as
  Fig. 48 indicates, is the general form of the curve; but the length of
  the middle portion varies with the temperature, being shorter at higher
  than at lower temperatures.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:27%;">
      <a href="images/fig048.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig048.png"
      alt="Fig. 48" title="Fig. 48" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 48.</span>
  </div>

  <p>What is the interpretation to be put on these curves? With regard to
  the two end portions, these represent bivariant, two-phase systems,
  consisting of a solid solution and gas. They correspond, therefore, to
  curve AB in Fig. 47. If the middle portion were horizontal, it would
  indicate either the formation of a compound or of two immiscible solid
  solutions. If a compound Pd<sub>2</sub>H were formed, then the middle
  portion would at all temperatures end at the same value of the
  concentration, viz. that corresponding to 0.5 atoms of hydrogen to 1 atom
  of palladium. As the figure shows, however, this is not the case; the
  higher the temperature, the lower is the concentration at which the
  middle passes into the terminal portion of the curve. <!-- Page 180
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page180"></a>{180}</span>Such a
  behaviour would, however, agree with the assumption of the formation of
  two solid solutions, the "miscibility" of which increases with the
  temperature, as in the case of the liquid solutions of phenol and water
  (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page97">97</a>). Nevertheless, although the assumption of
  the formation of two solid solutions is more satisfactory than that of
  the formation of a compound, it does not entirely explain the facts. If
  two solid solutions are formed, the pressure curve should be horizontal,
  but this is not the case; and the deviation from the horizontal does not
  appear to be due to impurities either in the gas or in the metal, but is
  apparently a peculiarity of the system. Further, the gradual instead of
  abrupt passage of the three portions of the curve into one another
  remains unexplained. Hoitsema has expressed the opinion that the
  occlusion of hydrogen by palladium is a process of continuous absorption,
  the peculiar form of the curve&mdash;the flat middle portion&mdash;being
  possibly due to a condensation of the gas, even at temperatures far above
  the critical temperature of liquid hydrogen.</p>

  <p>While, therefore, the occlusion of hydrogen by palladium still
  presents some unexplained phenomena, the behaviour found by Hoitsema

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Solution of Solids in Solids. Mixed Crystals.</span></p>

  <p>The introduction by van't Hoff of the term "solid solution" resulted
  from the discovery of a number of deviations from the Raoult-van't Hoff
  law for the depression of the freezing point by dissolved substances. In
  all cases, the depression was too small; in some instances, indeed, the
  freezing point may be raised. To explain these irregularities, van't Hoff
  assumed that the dissolved substance crystallized out along with the
  solid solvent; and he showed how this would account for the <!-- Page 181
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page181"></a>{181}</span>deviations
  from the law of the depression of the freezing point, which had been
  developed on the assumption that only the pure solvent crystallized out
  from the solution.<a name="NtA263" href="#Nt263"><sup>[263]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The "mixed crystals" which were thus obtained, and which van't Hoff
  called dilute solid solutions, showed great resemblance in their
  behaviour to ordinary liquid solutions, and obeyed the laws applicable to
  these. These laws, however, can no longer be applied in the case of the
  concentrated solid solutions formed by the crystallization together of
  isomorphous substances, and known as isomorphous mixtures. Indeed, it has
  been contended<a name="NtA264" href="#Nt264"><sup>[264]</sup></a> that
  these isomorphous mixtures should not be considered as solid solutions at
  all, although no sharp line of demarcation can be drawn between the two
  classes. The differences, however, in the behaviour of the two groups are
  of a quantitative rather than a qualitative nature; and since we are
  concerned at present only with the qualitative behaviour, we shall make
  no distinction between the crystalline solid solutions and the
  isomorphous mixtures, but shall study the behaviour of the two classes
  under the head of "mixed crystals."</p>

  <p>Mixed crystals can be formed either by sublimation<a name="NtA265"
  href="#Nt265"><sup>[265]</sup></a> or from a liquid phase; and in the
  latter case the mixed crystals can be deposited either from solution in a
  common solvent or from a mixture of the fused components. In this method
  of formation, which alone will be discussed in the present chapter, we
  are dealing with the fusion curves of two substances, where, however, the
  liquid solution is in equilibrium not with one of the pure components,
  but with a solid solution or mixed crystal. The simple scheme (Fig. 29,
  p.&nbsp;<a href="#page117">117</a>) which was obtained in the case of two
  components which crystallize out in the pure state, is no longer
  sufficient in the case of the formation of mixed crystals. With the help
  of the Phase Rule, however, the different possible systems can be
  classified; and examples of the different cases predicted by the Phase
  Rule have also been obtained by experiment.</p>

<p><!-- Page 182 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page182"></a>{182}</span></p>

  <p>We shall now consider briefly the formation of mixed crystals by
  isomorphous substances; the consideration of the formation of mixed
  crystals of isodimorphous substances will, on account of the complexity
  of the relationships, not be undertaken here.<a name="NtA266"
  href="#Nt266"><sup>[266]</sup></a></p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Formation of Mixed Crystals of Isomorphous Substances.</i></p>

  <p>For the purpose of representing the relationships found here we shall
  employ a temperature-concentration diagram,<a name="NtA267"
  href="#Nt267"><sup>[267]</sup></a> in which the ordinates represent the
  temperature and the abscissæ the concentration of the components. Since
  there are two solutions, the liquid and the solid, and since the
  concentration of the components in these two phases is not, in general,
  the same, two curves will be required for each system, one relating to
  the liquid phase, the other relating to the solid. The temperature at
  which solid begins to be deposited from the liquid solution will be
  called the <i>freezing point</i> of the mixture, and the temperature at
  which the solid solution just begins to liquefy will be called the
  <i>melting point</i> of the solid solution. The temperature-concentration
  curve for the liquid phase will therefore be the freezing-point curve;
  that for the solid solution, the melting-point curve. The latter will be
  represented by a dotted line.<a name="NtA268"

<p class="cenhead">I.&mdash;<span class="sc">The Two Components can form an Unbroken Series of Mixed Crystals.</span></p>

  <p>Since, as has already been pointed out (p.&nbsp;<a
  href="#page176">176</a>), a mixed crystal (solid solution) constitutes
  only one phase, it is evident that if the two components are miscible
  with one another in all proportions in the solid state, there can never
  be more than one solid phase present, viz. the solid solution or mixed
  crystal. If the components are completely miscible in the solid state,
  they will also be completely miscible in the liquid state, and there can
  therefore be only one liquid phase. The system can at no point become
  invariant, because there can never be more than three phases present.
  When, therefore, the two components form a continuous series of mixed
  crystals, the equilibrium curve must also be continuous. Of these systems
  three types are found.</p>

  <p>(<i>a</i>) <i>The freezing points of all mixtures lie between the
  freezing points of the pure components</i> (Curve I., Fig. 49).</p>

  <p><b>Examples.</b>&mdash;This type of curve is represented by the mixed
  crystals of naphthalene and <span class="grk">&beta;</span>-naphthol.<a
  name="NtA269" href="#Nt269"><sup>[269]</sup></a> The addition of <span

  point of the latter, and the rise is directly proportional to the amount
  of naphthol added. The freezing point curve is therefore a straight line
  joining the melting points of the two components. This behaviour,
  however, is rather exceptional, the freezing-point curve lying generally
  above, sometimes also below, the straight line joining the melting points
  of the pure components. Thus the freezing-point curve of mixtures of

  <p><b>Melting-point Curve.</b>&mdash;This curve, like the freezing-point
  curve, must also be continuous, and the melting points of the different
  solid solutions will lie between the melting points of the pure
  components. This is represented by the dotted line in Fig. 49, I. The
  relative position of the two curves, which can be deduced with the help
  of thermodynamics and also by experimental determination, is found in all
  cases to be in accordance with the following rule: At any given
  temperature, <i>the concentration of that component by the addition of
  which the freezing point is depressed, is greater in the liquid than in
  the solid phase</i>; or, conversely, <i>the concentration of that
  component by the addition of which the freezing point is raised, is
  greater in the solid than in the liquid phase</i>. An illustration of
  this rule is afforded by the two substances chloro- and bromo-cinnamic
  aldehyde already mentioned. As can be seen from the above table, the
  addition of chlorocinnamic aldehyde lowers the melting point of the
  bromo-compound. In accordance with the rule, therefore, the concentration
  of the chloro-compound in the liquid phase must be greater than in the
  solid phase; and this was found experimentally. At a temperature of
  49.44°, the liquid contained 58.52 per cent., the solid only 52.57 per
  cent. of the chlorocinnamic aldehyde.</p>

  <p>From this it will also be clear that on cooling a fused mixture of two
  substances capable of forming mixed crystals, <!-- Page 185 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page185"></a>{185}</span>the temperature of
  solidification will not remain constant during the separation of the
  solid; nor, on the other hand, will the temperature of liquefaction of
  the solid solution be constant. Thus, for example, if a liquid solution
  of two components, A and B, having the composition represented by the
  point <i>x</i> (Fig. 50), is allowed to cool, the system will pass along
  the line <i>xx&prime;</i>. At the temperature of the point <i>a</i>,
  mixed crystals will be deposited, the composition of which will be that
  represented by <i>b</i>. As the temperature continues to fall, more and
  more solid will be deposited; and since the solid phase is relatively
  rich in the component B, the liquid will become relatively poorer in
  this. The composition of the liquid solution will therefore pass along
  the curve <i>ad</i>, the composition of the solid solution at the same
  time passing along the curve <i>bc</i>; at the point <i>c</i> the liquid
  will solidify completely.<a name="NtA271"
  href="#Nt271"><sup>[271]</sup></a></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:21%;">
      <a href="images/fig050.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig050.png"
      alt="Fig. 50" title="Fig. 50" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 50.
  </div>

  <p>Conversely, if mixed crystals of the composition and at the
  temperature <i>x&prime;</i> are heated, liquefaction will begin at the
  temperature <i>c</i>, yielding a liquid of the composition <i>d</i>. On
  continuing to add heat, the temperature of the mass will rise, more of
  the solid will melt, and the composition of the two phases will change as
  represented by the curves <i>da</i> and <i>cb</i>. When the temperature
  has risen to <i>a</i>, complete liquefaction will have occurred. The
  process of solidification or of liquefaction is therefore extended over a
  temperature interval <i>ac</i>.</p>

  <p>Even when the freezing-point curve is a straight line joining <!--
  Page 186 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page186"></a>{186}</span>the
  melting points of the pure components, the melting-point curve will not
  necessarily coincide with the freezing-point curve, although it may
  approach very near to it; complete coincidence can take place only when
  the melting points of the two components are identical. An example of
  this will be given later (Chap. XII.).</p>

  <p>(<i>b</i>) <i>The freezing-point curve passes through a maximum</i>
  (Curve II., Fig. 49).</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:19%;">
      <a href="images/fig051.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig051.png"
      alt="Fig. 51" title="Fig. 51" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 51.
  </div>

  <p>This curve exhibits the greatest degree of contrast to the
  freezing-point curve which is obtained when the pure components
  crystallize out. For, since the curve passes through a maximum, it is
  evident that the freezing point of each of the components must be
  <i>raised</i> by the addition of the other component.</p>

  <p><b>Example.</b>&mdash;Very few cases belonging to this type are known.
  The best example is found in the freezing-point curve of mixtures of
  <i>d</i>- and <i>l</i>-carvoxime<a name="NtA272"
  href="#Nt272"><sup>[272]</sup></a> (C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>14</sub>N.OH).

  <p>In this figure, the melting-point curve, <i>i.e.</i> the
  temperature-concentration curve for the mixed crystals, is represented by
  the lower curve. Since the addition of the lævo-form to the dextro-form
  raises the melting point of the latter, the concentration of the
  lævo-form (on the right-hand branch of the curve) must, in accordance
  with the rule given, be greater in the solid phase than in the liquid.
  Similarly, since addition of the dextro-form raises the melting point of
  the lævo-form, the solid phase (on the left-hand branch of the curve)
  must be richer in dextro- than in lævo-carvoxime. At the maximum point,
  the melting-point and freezing-point curves touch; at this point,
  therefore, the composition of the solid and liquid phases must be
  identical. It is evident, therefore, that at the maximum point the liquid
  will solidify, or the solid will liquefy completely without change of
  temperature; and, accordingly, mixed crystals of the composition
  represented by the maximum point will exhibit a definite melting point,
  and will in this respect behave like a simple substance.</p>

  <p>(<i>c</i>) <i>The freezing-point curve passes through a minimum</i>
  (Curve III., Fig. 49).</p>

  <p>In this case, as in the case of those systems where the pure
  components are deposited, a minimum freezing point is obtained. In the
  latter case, however, there are two freezing-point curves which intersect
  at a eutectic point; in the case where mixed crystals are formed there is
  only one continuous curve. On one side of the minimum point the liquid
  phase contains relatively more, on the other side relatively less, of the
  one component than does the solid phase; while at the minimum point the
  composition of the two phases is the same. At this point, therefore,
  complete solidification or complete liquefaction will occur without
  change of temperature, and the mixed crystals will accordingly exhibit a
  definite melting point.</p>

  <p><b>Fractional Crystallization of Mixed Crystals.</b>&mdash;With the
  help of the diagrams already given it will be possible to predict what
  will be the result of the fractional crystallization of a fused mixture
  of two substances which can form mixed crystals. Suppose, for example, a
  fused mixture of the composition <i>x</i> (Fig. 53) is cooled down; then,
  as we have already seen, when the temperature has fallen to <i>a</i>,
  mixed crystals of composition, <i>b</i>, are deposited. If the
  temperature is allowed to fall <!-- Page 189 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page189"></a>{189}</span>to <i>x&prime;</i>, and the solid then
  separated from the liquid, the mixed crystals so obtained will have the
  composition represented by <i>e</i>. If, now, the mixed crystals <i>e</i>
  are completely fused and the fused mass allowed to cool, separation of
  solid will occur when the temperature has fallen to the point <i>f</i>.
  The mixed crystals which are deposited have now the composition
  represented by <i>g</i>, i.e. <i>they are richer in B than the original
  mixed crystals</i>. By repeating this process, the composition of the
  successive crops of mixed crystals which are obtained approximates more
  and more to that of the pure component B, while, on the other hand, the
  composition of the liquid phase produced tends to that of pure A. By a
  systematic and methodical repetition of the process of fractional
  crystallization, therefore, a <i>practically</i> complete separation of
  the components can be effected; a perfect separation is theoretically
  impossible.</p>

  <p>From this it will be readily understood that in the case of substances
  the freezing point of which passes through a maximum, fractional
  crystallization will ultimately lead to mixed crystals having the
  composition of the maximum point, while the liquid phase will more and
  more assume the composition of either pure A or pure B, according as the
  initial composition was on the A side or the B side of the maximum point.
  In those cases, however, where the curves exhibit a minimum, the solid
  phase which separates out will ultimately be one of the pure components,
  while a liquid phase will finally be obtained which has the composition
  of the minimum point.</p>

<p class="cenhead">II.&mdash;<span class="sc">The Two Components do not form a Continuous Series of Mixed Crystals.</span></p>

  <p>This case corresponds to that of the partial miscibility of liquids.
  The solid component A can "dissolve" the component B until the
  concentration of the latter in the mixed crystal has reached a certain
  value. Addition of a further amount of B will not alter the composition
  of the mixed crystal, but there will be formed a second solid phase
  consisting <!-- Page 190 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page190"></a>{190}</span>of a solution of A in B. At this point the
  four phases, mixed crystals containing excess of A, mixed crystals
  containing excess of B, liquid solution, vapour, can coexist; this will
  therefore be an invariant point. The temperature-concentration curves
  will therefore no longer be continuous, but will exhibit a break or
  discontinuity at the point at which the invariant system is formed.</p>

  <p>(<i>a</i>) <i>The freezing-point curve exhibits a transition point</i>
  (Curve I., Fig. 54).</p>

  <p>As is evident from the figure, addition of B raises the melting point
  of A, and, in accordance with the rule previously given, the
  concentration of B in the mixed crystals will be greater than in the
  solution. This is represented in the figure by the dotted curve AD. On
  the other hand, addition of A lowers the melting point of B, and the two
  curves BC and BE are obtained for the liquid and solid phases
  respectively. At the temperature of the line CDE the liquid solution of
  the composition represented by C is in equilibrium with the two different
  mixed crystals represented by D and E. At this temperature, therefore,
  the <i>tc</i>-curve for the solid phase exhibits a discontinuity; and,
  since the solid phase undergoes change at this point, the freezing-point
  curve must show a break (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page111">111</a>).</p>

  <p>At the eutectic point the liquid solution is in equilibrium with two
  different mixed crystals the composition of which is represented by D and
  E respectively. If, therefore, a fused mixture containing the two
  components A and B in the proportions represented by C is cooled down, it
  will, when the temperature has reached the point C, solidify completely
  to a <i>conglomerate</i> of mixed crystals, D and E.</p>

  <p><b>Changes in Mixed Crystals with the Temperature.</b>&mdash;In the
  case of the different types of systems represented in Fig. 49, a
  homogeneous liquid solution of the two components will exist at
  temperatures above the freezing-point curve, a homogeneous mixed crystal
  at temperatures below the melting-point curve, while at any point between
  the freezing-point and melting-point <!-- Page 193 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page193"></a>{193}</span>curves the mixture will
  separate into a solid phase and a liquid phase. In the case, however, of
  the two types shown in Fig. 54 the relationships are somewhat more
  complicated. As before, the area above the freezing-point curve gives the
  conditions under which homogeneous liquid solutions can exist; but below
  the melting-point curve two different mixed crystals can coexist. This
  will be best understood from Figs. 57 and 58. D and E represent, as we
  have seen, the composition of two mixed crystals which are in equilibrium
  with the liquid solution at the temperature of the point C. These two
  mixed crystals represent, in the one case, a saturated solution of B in A
  (point D), and the other a saturated solution of A in B (point E). Just
  as we saw that the mutual solubility of two liquids varied with the
  temperature, so also in the case of two solids; as the temperature
  alters, the solubility of the two solid components in one another will
  change. This alteration is indicated diagrammatically in Figs. 57 and 58
  by the dotted curve similar to the solubility curves for two mutually
  soluble liquids (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page101">101</a>).</p>

  <p>Suppose, now, that a mixed crystal of the composition <i>x</i> is
  cooled down, it will remain unchanged until, when the temperature has
  fallen to <i>t&prime;</i>, the homogeneous mixed crystal breaks up into a
  conglomerate of two mixed crystals the composition of <!-- Page 194
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page194"></a>{194}</span>which is
  represented by <i>x&prime;</i> and <i>x&Prime;</i> respectively. From
  this, then, it can be seen that in the case of substances which form two
  solid solutions, the mixed crystals which are desposited from the liquid
  fused mass need not remain unchanged in the solid state, but may at some
  lower temperature lose their homogeneity. This fact is of considerable
  importance for the formation of alloys.<a name="NtA277"
  href="#Nt277"><sup>[277]</sup></a></p>

  <p>A good example of this will soon be met with in the case of the iron
  and carbon alloys. The alloys of copper and tin also furnish examples of
  the great changes which may take place in the alloy between the
  temperature at which it separates out from the fused mass and the
  ordinary temperature. Thus, for example, one of the alloys of copper and
  tin which separates out from the liquid as a solid solution breaks up, on
  cooling, into the compound Cu<sub>3</sub>Sn and liquid:<a name="NtA278"

<h3>CHAPTER XI</h3>

<p class="cenhead">EQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN DYNAMIC ISOMERIDES</p>

  <p>It has long been known that certain substances, <i>e.g.</i>
  acetoacetic ester, are capable when in solution or in the fused state, of
  reacting as if they possessed two different constitutions; and in order
  to explain this behaviour the view was advanced (by Laar) that in such
  cases a hydrogen atom oscillated between two positions in the molecule,
  being at one time attached to oxygen, at another time to carbon, as
  represented by the formula&mdash;</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:12%;">
      <a href="images/211.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/211.png"
      alt="acetoacetic ester" title="acetoacetic ester" /></a>
  </div>
  <p>When the hydrogen is in one position, the substance will act as an
  hydroxy-compound; with hydrogen in the other position, as a ketone.
  Substances possessing this double function are called
  <i>tautomeric</i>.</p>

  <p>Doubt, however, arose as to the validity of the above explanation, and
  this doubt was confirmed by the isolation of the two isomerides in the
  solid state, and also by the fact that the velocity of change of the one
  isomeride into the other could in some cases be quantitatively measured.
  These and other observations then led to the view, in harmony with the
  laws of chemical dynamics, that tautomeric substances in the dissolved or
  fused state represent a <i>mixture</i> of two isomeric forms, and that
  equilibrium is established not by <i>intra</i>- but by
  <i>inter</i>-molecular change, as expressed by the equation&mdash;</p>

<p class="cenhead">CH<sub>3</sub>.CO.CH<sub>2</sub>.CO<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub> <a href="images/doublearrow.png"><img src="images/doublearrow.png" class="middle" style="height:2.5ex" alt="reversible arrow" /></a> CH<sub>3</sub>.C(OH):CH.CO<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub></p>

<p><!-- Page 196 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page196"></a>{196}</span></p>

  <p>In the solid state, the one or other of the isomerides represents the
  stable form; but in the liquid state (solution or fusion) the stable
  condition is an equilibrium between the two forms.</p>

  <p>A similar behaviour is also found in the case of other isomeric
  substances where the isomerism is due to difference of structure,
  <i>i.e.</i> structure isomerism (<i>e.g.</i> in the case of the oximes <a

  href="images/212b.png"><img src="images/212b.png" class="middle"
  style="height:6ex" alt="alpha form" /></a>, or to difference in
  configuration, <i>i.e.</i> stereoisomerism (<i>e.g.</i> optically active
  substances), or to polymerism (<i>e.g.</i> acetaldehyde and paraldehyde).
  In all such cases, although the different solid forms correspond to a
  single definite constitution, in the liquid state a condition of
  equilibrium between the two modifications is established. As a general
  name for these different classes of substances, the term "dynamic
  isomerides" has been introduced; and the different kinds of isomerism are
  classed together under the title "dynamic isomerism."<a name="NtA279"
  href="#Nt279"><sup>[279]</sup></a></p>

  <p>By reason of the importance of these phenomena in the study more
  especially of Organic Chemistry, a brief account of the equilibrium
  relations exhibited by systems composed of dynamic isomerides may be
  given here.<a name="NtA280" href="#Nt280"><sup>[280]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In studying the fusion and solidification of those substances which
  exhibit the relationships of dynamic isomerism, the phenomena observed
  will vary somewhat according as the reversible transformation of the one
  form into the other takes place with measurable velocity at temperatures
  in the neighbourhood of the melting points, or only at some higher
  temperature. If the transformation is very rapid, the system will behave
  like a one-component system, but if the isomeric change is comparatively
  slow, the behaviour will be that of a two-component system.</p>

  <p><b>Temperature-Concentration Diagram.</b>&mdash;The relationships
  which are met with here will be most readily understood with <!-- Page
  197 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page197"></a>{197}</span>the help
  of Fig. 59. Suppose, in the first instance, that isomeric transformation
  does not take place at the temperature of the melting point, then the
  freezing point curve will have the simple form ACB; the formation of
  compounds being for the present excluded. This is the simplest type of
  curve, and gives the composition of the solutions in equilibrium with the
  one modification (<span class="grk">&alpha;</span> modification) at
  different temperatures (curve AC); and of the solutions in equilibrium
  with the other modification (<span class="grk">&beta;</span>
  modification) at different temperatures (curve BC). C is the eutectic
  point at which the two solid isomerides can exist side by side in contact
  with the solution.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:24%;">
      <a href="images/fig059.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig059.png"
      alt="Fig. 59" title="Fig. 59" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig</span>. 59.
  </div>

  <p>Now, suppose that isomeric transformation takes place with measurable
  velocity. If the pure <span class="grk">&alpha;</span>-modification is
  heated to a temperature <i>t&prime;</i> above its melting point, and the
  liquid maintained at that temperature until equilibrium has been
  established, a certain amount of the <span class="grk">&beta;</span>-form
  will be present in the liquid, the composition of which will be
  represented by the point <i>x&prime;</i>. The same condition of
  equilibrium will also be reached by starting with pure <span
  class="grk">&beta;</span>. Similarly, if the temperature of the liquid is
  maintained at the temperature <i>t&Prime;</i>, equilibrium will be
  reached, we shall suppose, when the solution has the composition
  <i>x&Prime;</i>. The curve DE, therefore, which passes through all the
  different values of <i>x</i> corresponding to different values of
  <i>t</i>, will represent the change of equilibrium with the temperature.
  It will slope to the right (as in the figure) if the transformation of
  <span class="grk">&alpha;</span> into <span class="grk">&beta;</span> is
  accompanied by absorption of heat; to the left if the transformation is
  accompanied by evolution of heat, in accordance with van't Hoff's Law of
  movable equilibrium. If transformation occurs without heat effect, the
  equilibrium will be independent of the <!-- Page 198 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page198"></a>{198}</span>temperature, and the
  equilibrium curve DE will therefore be perpendicular and parallel to the
  temperature axis.</p>

  <p>We must now find the meaning of the point D. Suppose the pure <span
  class="grk">&alpha;</span>- or pure <span class="grk">&beta;</span>-form
  heated to the temperature <i>t&prime;</i>, and the temperature maintained
  constant until the liquid has the composition <i>x&prime;</i>
  corresponding to the equilibrium at that temperature. If the temperature
  is now allowed to fall sufficiently slowly so that the condition of
  equilibrium is continually readjusted as the temperature changes, the
  composition of the solution will gradually alter as represented by the
  curve <i>x&prime;</i>D. Since D is on the freezing point curve of pure
  <span class="grk">&alpha;</span>, this form will be deposited on cooling;
  and since D is also on the equilibrium curve of the liquid, D is the only
  point at which solid can exist in stable equilibrium with the liquid
  phase. (The vapour phase may be omitted from consideration, as we shall
  suppose the experiments carried out in open vessels.) All systems
  consisting of the two hylotropic<a name="NtA281"
  href="#Nt281"><sup>[281]</sup></a> isomeric substances <span
  class="grk">&alpha;</span> and <span class="grk">&beta;</span> will,
  therefore, ultimately freeze at the point D, which is called the
  "natural" freezing point<a name="NtA282"
  href="#Nt282"><sup>[282]</sup></a> of the system; provided, of course,
  that sufficient time is allowed for equilibrium to be established. From
  this it is apparent that <i>the stable modification at temperatures in
  the neighbourhood of the melting point is that which is in equilibrium
  with the liquid phase at the natural freezing point</i>.</p>

  <p>From what has been said, it will be easy to predict what will be the
  behaviour of the system under different conditions. If pure <span
  class="grk">&alpha;</span> is heated, a temperature will be reached at
  which it will melt, but this melting point will be sharp only if the
  velocity of isomeric transformation is comparatively slow; <i>i.e.</i>
  slow in comparison with the determination of the melting point. If the
  substance be maintained in the fused condition for some time, a certain
  amount of the <span class="grk">&beta;</span> modification will be
  formed, and on lowering the temperature the pure <span
  class="grk">&alpha;</span> form will be deposited, not at the temperature
  of the melting point, but at some lower temperature depending on the
  concentration of the <span class="grk">&beta;</span> modification in the
  liquid phase. If isomeric transformation <!-- Page 199 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page199"></a>{199}</span>takes place slowly in
  comparison with the rate at which deposition of the solid occurs, the
  liquid will become increasingly rich in the <span
  class="grk">&beta;</span> modification, and the freezing point will,
  therefore, sink continuously. At the eutectic point, however, the <span
  class="grk">&beta;</span> modification will also be deposited, and the
  temperature will remain constant until all has become solid. If, on the
  other hand, the velocity of transformation is sufficiently rapid, then as
  quickly as the <span class="grk">&alpha;</span> modification is
  deposited, the equilibrium between the two isomeric forms in the liquid
  phase will continuously readjust itself, and the end-point of
  solidification will be the natural freezing point.</p>

  <p>Similarly, starting with the pure <span class="grk">&beta;</span>
  modification, the freezing point after fusion will gradually fall owing
  to the formation of the <span class="grk">&alpha;</span> modification;
  and the composition of the liquid phase will pass along the curve BC. If,
  now, the rate of cooling is not too great, or if the velocity of isomeric
  transformation is sufficiently rapid, complete solidification will not
  occur at the eutectic point; for at this temperature solid and liquid are
  not in stable equilibrium with one another. On the contrary, a further
  quantity of the <span class="grk">&beta;</span> modification will undergo
  isomeric change, the liquid phase will become richer in the <span
  class="grk">&alpha;</span> form, and the freezing point will <i>rise</i>;
  the solid phase in contact with the liquid being now the <span
  class="grk">&alpha;</span> modification. The freezing point will continue
  to rise until the point D is reached, at which complete solidification
  will take place without further change of temperature.</p>

  <p>The diagram also allows us to predict what will be the result of
  rapidly cooling a fused mixture of the two isomerides. Suppose that
  either the <span class="grk">&alpha;</span> or the <span
  class="grk">&beta;</span> modification has been maintained in the fused
  state at the temperature <i>t&prime;</i> sufficiently long for
  equilibrium to be established. The composition of the liquid phase will
  be represented by <i>x&prime;</i>. If the liquid is now <i>rapidly</i>
  cooled, the composition will remain unchanged as represented by the
  dotted line <i>x&prime;</i>G. At the temperature of the point G solid
  <span class="grk">&alpha;</span> modification will be deposited. If the
  cooling is not carried below the point G, so as to cause complete
  solidification, the freezing point will be found to rise with time, owing
  to the conversion of some of the <span class="grk">&beta;</span> form
  into the <span class="grk">&alpha;</span> form <!-- Page 200 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page200"></a>{200}</span>in the liquid phase;
  and this will continue until the composition of the liquid has reached
  the point D. From what has just been said, it can also be seen that if
  the freezing point curves can be obtained by actual determination of the
  freezing points of different synthetic mixtures of the two isomerides, it
  will be possible to determine the condition of equilibrium in the fused
  state at any given temperature without having recourse to analysis. All
  that is necessary is to rapidly cool the fused mass, after equilibrium
  has been established, and find the freezing point at which solid is
  deposited; that is, find the point at which the line of constant
  temperature cuts the freezing point curve. The composition corresponding
  to this temperature gives the composition of the equilibrium mixture at
  the given temperature.</p>

  <p>It will be evident, from what has gone before, that the degree of
  completeness with which the different curves can be realised will depend
  on the velocity with which isomeric change takes place, and on the
  rapidity with which the determinations of the freezing point can be
  carried out. As the two extremes we have, on the one hand, practically
  instantaneous transformation, and on the other, practically infinite
  slowness of transformation. In the former case, only one melting and
  freezing point will be found, viz. the natural freezing point; in the
  latter case, the two isomerides will behave as two perfectly independent
  components, and the equilibrium curve DE will not be realised.</p>

  <p>The diagram which is obtained when isomeric transformation does not
  occur within measurable time at the temperature of the melting point is
  somewhat different from that already given in Fig. 59. In this case, the
  two freezing point curves AC and BC (Fig. 60) can be readily realized, as
  no isomeric change occurs in the liquid phase. Suppose, however, that at
  a higher temperature, <i>t&prime;</i>, reversible isomeric transformation
  can take place, the composition of the liquid phase will alter until at
  the point <i>x&prime;</i> a condition of equilibrium is reached; and the
  composition of the liquid at higher temperatures will be represented by
  the curve <i>x&prime;</i>F. Below the temperature <i>t&prime;</i> the
  position of the equilibrium curve is hypothetical; but as the temperature
  <!-- Page 201 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page201"></a>{201}</span>falls the velocity of transformation
  diminishes, and at last becomes <i>practically</i> zero. The equilibrium
  curve can therefore be regarded as dividing into two branches
  <i>x&prime;</i>G and <i>x&prime;</i>H. At temperatures between G and
  <i>t&prime;</i> the <span class="grk">&alpha;</span> modification can
  undergo isomeric change leading to a point on the curve G<i>x&prime;</i>;
  and the <span class="grk">&beta;</span> modification can undergo change
  leading to a point on the curve H<i>x&prime;</i>. The same condition of
  equilibrium is therefore not reached from each side, and we are therefore
  dealing not with true but with false equilibrium (p.&nbsp;<a
  href="#page5">5</a>). Below the temperatures G and H, isomeric
  transformation does not occur in measurable time. We shall not, however,
  enter into a detailed discussion of the equilibria in such systems, more
  especially as they are not systems in true equilibrium, and as the
  temperature at which true equilibrium can be established with appreciable
  velocity alters under the influence of catalytic agents.<a name="NtA283"
  href="#Nt283"><sup>[283]</sup></a> Examples of such systems will no doubt
  be found in the case of optically active substances, where both
  isomerides are apparently quite stable at the melting point. In the case
  of such substances, also, the action of catalytic agents in producing
  isomeric transformation (racemisation) is well known.</p>

  </div>

  <p><b>Transformation of the Unstable into the Stable Form.</b>&mdash;As
  has already been stated, the stable modification in the neighbourhood of
  the melting point is that one which is in equilibrium with the liquid
  phase at the natural freezing point. In the case of polymorphic
  substances, we have seen (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page39">39</a>) that that form
  which is stable in the neighbourhood of the melting point melts at the
  higher temperature. That was a <!-- Page 202 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page202"></a>{202}</span>consequence of the fact that the two
  polymorphic forms on melting gave identical liquid phases. In the present
  case, however, the above rule does not apply, for the simple reason that
  the liquid phase obtained by the fusion of the one modification is not
  identical with that obtained by the fusion of the other. In the case of
  isomeric substances, therefore, the form of lower melting point
  <i>may</i> be the more stable; and where this behaviour is found it is a
  sign that the two forms are isomeric (or polymeric) and not
  polymorphic.<a name="NtA284" href="#Nt284"><sup>[284]</sup></a> An
  example of this is found in the case of the isomeric benzaldoximes (p.&nbsp;<a
  href="#page203">203</a>).</p>

  <p>Since in Fig. 59 the <span class="grk">&alpha;</span> modification has
  been represented as the stable form, the transformation of the <span
  class="grk">&beta;</span> into the <span class="grk">&alpha;</span> form
  will be possible at all temperatures down to the transition point. At
  temperatures below the eutectic point, transformation will occur without
  formation of a liquid phase; but at temperatures above the eutectic point
  liquefaction can take place. This will be more readily understood by
  drawing a line of constant temperature, HK, at some point between C and
  B. Then if the <span class="grk">&beta;</span> modification is maintained
  for a sufficiently long time at that temperature, a certain amount of the
  <span class="grk">&alpha;</span> modification will be formed; and when
  the composition of the mixture has reached the point H, fusion will
  occur. If the temperature is maintained constant, isomeric transformation
  will continue to take place in the liquid phase until the equilibrium
  point for that temperature is reached. If this temperature is higher than
  the natural melting point, the mixture will remain liquid all the time;
  but if it is below the natural melting point, then the <span
  class="grk">&alpha;</span> modification will be deposited when the system
  reaches the condition represented by the point on the curve AC
  corresponding to the particular temperature. As isomeric transformation
  continues, the freezing point of the system will rise until it reaches
  the natural freezing point D. Similarly, if the <span
  class="grk">&alpha;</span> modification is maintained at a temperature
  above that of the point D, liquefaction will ultimately occur, and the
  system will again reach the final state represented by D.<a name="NtA285"

  <p>The eutectic point C was found to lie at 25-26°, and the natural
  freezing point D was found to be 27.7°. The equilibrium curve DE was
  determined by heating the liquid mixtures at different temperatures until
  equilibrium was attained, and then rapidly cooling the liquid. In all
  cases the freezing point was practically that of the point D. From this
  it is seen that the equilibrium curve must be a straight line parallel to
  the temperature axis; and, therefore, isomeric transformation in the case
  of the two benzaldoximes is not accompanied by any heat effect (p.&nbsp;<a
  href="#page197">197</a>). This behaviour has also been found in the case
  of acetaldoxime.<a name="NtA287" href="#Nt287"><sup>[287]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The isomeric benzaldoximes are also of interest from the fact that the
  stable modification has the <i>lower</i> melting point (<i>v.</i> p.
  202).</p>

  <p><i>Acetaldehyde and Paraldehyde.</i>&mdash;As a second example of the
  equilibria between two isomerides, we shall take the two isomeric
  (polymeric) forms of acetaldehyde, which have recently been exhaustively
  studied.<a name="NtA288" href="#Nt288"><sup>[288]</sup></a></p>

  <p>takes place at the ordinary temperature with very great slowness. For
  this reason it is possible to determine the freezing point curves of
  acetaldehyde and paraldehyde. The three chief points on these curves,
  represented graphically in Fig. 62, are:&mdash;</p>

  <p>In order to determine the position of the natural melting point, it
  was necessary, on account of the slowness of transformation, to employ a
  catalytic agent in order to increase the velocity with which the
  equilibrium was established. A drop of concentrated sulphuric acid served
  the purpose. In presence of a trace of this substance, isomeric
  transformation very speedily occurs, and leads to the condition of
  equilibrium. Starting in the one case with fused paraldehyde, and in the
  other case with acetaldehyde, the same freezing point, viz. 6.75°, was
  obtained, the solid phase being paraldehyde. This temperature, 6.75°, is
  therefore the natural freezing point, and paraldehyde, the solid in
  equilibrium with the liquid phase at this point, is the stable form.</p>

  <p>With regard to the change of equilibrium with the temperature, it was
  found that whereas the liquid phase contained 11.7 molecules per cent. of
  acetaldehyde at the natural freezing point, the liquid at the temperature
  of 41.6° contains 46.6 molecules per cent. of acetaldehyde. As the
  temperature <!-- Page 206 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page206"></a>{206}</span>rises, therefore, there is increased
  formation of acetaldehyde, or a decreasing amount of polymerisation. This
  is in harmony with the fact that the polymerisation of acetaldehyde is
  accompanied by evolution of heat.</p>

  <p>While speaking of these isomerides, it may be mentioned that at the
  temperature 41.6° the equilibrium mixture has a vapour pressure equal to
  the atmospheric pressure. At this temperature, therefore, the equilibrium
  mixture (obtained quickly with the help of a trace of sulphuric acid)
  boils.<a name="NtA289" href="#Nt289"><sup>[289]</sup></a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII</h3>

<p class="cenhead">SUMMARY.&mdash;APPLICATION OF THE PHASE RULE TO
THE STUDY OF SYSTEMS OF TWO COMPONENTS</p>

  <p>In this concluding chapter on two-component systems, it is proposed to
  indicate briefly how the Phase Rule has been applied to the elucidation
  of a number of problems connected with the equilibria between two
  components, and how it has been employed for the interpretation of the
  data obtained by experiment. It is hoped that the practical value of the
  Phase Rule may thereby become more apparent, and its application to other
  cases be rendered easier.</p>

  <p>The interest and importance of investigations into the conditions of
  equilibrium between two substances, lie in the determination not only of
  the conditions for the stable existence of the participating substances,
  but also of whether or not chemical action takes place between these two
  components; and if combination occurs, in the determination of the nature
  of the compounds formed and the range of their existence. In all such
  investigations, the Phase Rule becomes of conspicuous value on account of
  the fact that its principles afford, as it were, a touchstone by which
  the character of the system can be determined, and that from the form of
  the equilibrium curves obtained, conclusions can be drawn as to the
  nature of the interaction between the two substances. In order to
  exemplify the application of the principles of the Phase Rule more fully
  than has already been done, illustrations will be drawn from
  investigations on the interaction of organic compounds; on the equilibria
  between optically active compounds; and on alloys. <!-- Page 208 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page208"></a>{208}</span></p>

  <p><b>Summary of the Different Systems of Two
  Components.</b>&mdash;Before passing to the consideration of the
  application of the Phase Rule to the investigation of particular
  problems, it will be well to collect together the different types of
  equilibrium curves with which we are already acquainted; to compare them
  with one another, in order that we may then employ these characteristic
  curves for the interpretation of the curves obtained as the result of
  experiment.</p>

  <p>In investigating the equilibria between two components, three chief
  classes of curves will be obtained according as&mdash;</p>

  <p>I. No combination takes place between the two components.</p>

  <p>II. The components can form definite compounds.</p>

  <p>III. The components separate out in the form of mixed crystals.</p>

  <p>The different types of curves which are obtained in these three cases
  are represented in Figs. 63, 64, 65. These different diagrams represent
  the whole series of equilibria, from the melting point of the one
  component (A) to that of the other component (B). The curves represent,
  in all cases, the composition of the solution, or phase of variable
  composition; the temperature being measured along one axis, and the
  composition along the other.</p>

  <p>We shall now recapitulate very briefly the characteristics of the
  different curves.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:35%;">
      <a href="images/fig063.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig063.png"
      alt="Fig. 63" title="Fig. 63" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 63.
  </div>

  <p>If no compound is formed between the two components, <!-- Page 209
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page209"></a>{209}</span>the general
  form of the equilibrium curve will be that of curve I. or II., Fig. 63.
  Type I. is the simplest form of curve found, and consists, as the diagram
  shows, of only two branches, AC and BC, meeting at the point C, <i>which
  lies below the melting point of either component</i>. The solid phase
  which is in equilibrium with the solutions AC is pure A; that in
  equilibrium with BC, pure B. C is the eutectic point. Although at the
  eutectic point the solution solidifies entirely without change of
  temperature, the solid which is deposited is not a homogeneous solid
  phase, but a mixture, or conglomerate of the two components. <i>The
  eutectic point, therefore, represents the melting or freezing point, not
  of a compound, but of a mixture</i> (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page119">119</a>).</p>

  <p>Curve II., Fig. 63, is obtained when two liquid phases are formed. C
  is an eutectic point, D and F are transition points at which there can
  co-exist the four phases&mdash;solid, two liquid phases, vapour. DEF
  represents the change in the composition of the two liquid phases with
  rise of temperature; the curve might also have the reversed form with the
  critical solution point below the transition points D and F.</p>

<div style="clear: both"></div>
  <div class="figright" style="width:22%;">
      <a href="images/fig064.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig064.png"
      alt="Fig. 64" title="Fig. 64" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 64.
  </div>

  <p>In the second class of systems (Fig. 64), that in which combination
  between the components occurs, there are again two types according as the
  compound formed has a definite melting point (<i>i.e.</i> can exist in
  equilibrium with a solution of the same composition), or undergoes only
  partial fusion; that is, exhibits a transition point.</p>

  <p>If a compound possessing a definite melting point is formed, the
  equilibrium curve will have the general form shown by curve I., Fig. 64.
  A, B, and D are the melting points of pure A, pure B, and of the compound
  A<sub>x</sub>B<sub>y</sub> respectively. AC <!-- Page 210 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page210"></a>{210}</span>is the freezing point
  curve of A in presence of B; BE that of B in presence of A; and DC and DE
  the freezing point curves of the compound in presence of a solution
  containing excess of one of the components. C and E are eutectic points
  at which mixtures of A and A<sub>x</sub>B<sub>y</sub>, or B and
  A<sub>x</sub>B<sub>y</sub> can co-exist in contact with solution. The
  curve CDE may be large or small, and the melting point of the compound,
  D, may lie above or below that of each of the components, or may have an
  intermediate position. If more than one compound can be formed, a series
  of curves similar to CDE will be obtained (<i>cf.</i> p.&nbsp;<a
  href="#page152">152</a>).</p>

  <p>On the other hand, if the compound undergoes transition to another
  solid phase at a temperature below its melting point, a curve of the form
  II., Fig. 64, will be found. This corresponds to the case where a
  compound can exist only in contact with solutions containing excess of
  one of the components. The metastable continuation of the equilibrium
  curve for the compound is indicated by the dotted line, the summit of
  which would be the melting point of the compound. Before this temperature
  is reached, however, the solid compound ceases to be able to exist in
  contact with solution, and transition to a different solid phase occurs
  at the point E (<i>cf.</i> p.&nbsp;<a href="#page134">134</a>). This point,
  therefore, represents the limit of the existence of the compound AB. If a
  series of compounds can be formed none of which possess a definite
  melting point, then a series of curves will be obtained which do not
  exhibit a temperature-maximum, and there will be only one eutectic point.
  The limits of existence of each compound will be marked by a break in the
  curve (<i>cf.</i> p.&nbsp;<a href="#page143">143</a>).</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:18%;">
      <a href="images/fig065.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig065.png"
      alt="Fig. 65" title="Fig. 65" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 65.
  </div>

  <p>Turning, lastly, to the third class of systems, in which formation of
  mixed crystals can occur, five different types of curves can be obtained,
  as shown in Fig. 65. With regard to the first three types, curves I.,
  II., and III., <!-- Page 211 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page211"></a>{211}</span>these differ entirely from those of the
  previous classes, in that they are continuous; they exhibit no eutectic
  point, and no transition point. Curve II. bears some resemblance to the
  melting-point curve of a compound (<i>e.g.</i> CDE, Fig. 64, I.), but
  differs markedly from it in not ending in eutectic points.</p>

  <p>Further, in the case of the formation of a compound, the composition
  of the solid phase remains unchanged throughout the whole curve between
  the eutectic points; whereas, when mixed crystals are produced, the
  composition of the solid phase varies with the composition of the liquid
  solution. On passing through the maximum, the relative proportions of A
  and B in the solid and the liquid phase undergo change; on the one side
  of the maximum, the solid phase contains relatively more A, and on the
  other side of the maximum, relatively more B than the liquid phase.
  Lastly, when mixed crystals are formed, the temperature at which complete
  solidification occurs changes as the composition of the solution changes,
  whereas in the case of the formation of compounds, the temperature of
  complete solidification for all solutions is a eutectic point.</p>

  <p>The third type of curve, Fig. 65, can be distinguished in a similar
  manner from the ordinary eutectic curve, Fig. 63, I., to which it bears a
  certain resemblance. Whereas in the case of the latter, the eutectic
  point is the temperature of complete solidification of all solutions, the
  point of minimum temperature in the case of the formation of mixed
  crystals, is the solidification point only of solutions having one
  particular composition; that, namely, of the minimum point. For all other
  solutions, the temperature of complete solidification is different.
  Whereas, also, in the case of the simple eutectic curve, the solid which
  separates out from the solutions represented by either curve remains the
  same throughout the whole extent of that curve, the composition of the
  mixed crystal varies with variation of the composition of the liquid
  phase, and the relative proportions of the two components in the solid
  and the liquid phase are reversed on passing through the minimum.<a
  name="NtA290" href="#Nt290"><sup>[290]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In a similar manner, type IV., Fig. 65, can be distinguished from type
  II., Fig. 64, by the fact that it does not exhibit a <!-- Page 212
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page212"></a>{212}</span>eutectic
  point, and that the composition of the solid phase undergoes continuous
  variation with variation of the liquid phase on either side of the
  transition point. Lastly, type V., which does exhibit a eutectic point,
  differs from the eutectic curve of Fig. 63, in that the eutectic point
  does not constitute the point of complete solidification for all
  solutions, and that the composition of the solid phase varies with the
  composition of the liquid phase.</p>

  <p>Such, then, are the chief general types of equilibrium curves for
  two-components; they are the pattern curves with which other curves,
  experimentally determined, can be compared; and from the comparison it
  will be possible to draw conclusions as to the nature of the equilibria
  between the two components under investigation.</p>

<p class="cenhead">1. <i>Organic Compounds.</i></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:44%;">
      <a href="images/fig066.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig066.png"
      alt="Fig. 66" title="Fig. 66" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 66.
  </div>

  <p>The principles of the Phase Rule have been applied to the
  investigation of the equilibria between organic compounds, and Figs.
  66-69 reproduce some of the results which have been obtained.<a
  name="NtA291" href="#Nt291"><sup>[291]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 213 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page213"></a>{213}</span></p>

  <p>Fig. 66, the freezing point curve (curve of equilibrium) for
  <i>o</i>-nitrophenol and <i>p</i>-toluidine, shows a curve of the
  simplest type<a name="NtA292" href="#Nt292"><sup>[292]</sup></a> (type
  I., Fig. 63), in which two branches meet at an eutectic point. The solid
  phase in equilibrium with solutions represented by the left-hand branch
  of the curve was <i>o</i>-nitrophenol (m.p. 44.1°); that in equilibrium
  with the solutions represented by the right-hand branch, was
  <i>p</i>-toluidine (m.p. 43.3°). At the eutectic point (15.6°), these two
  solid phases could co-exist with the liquid phase. This equilibrium
  curve, therefore, shows that <i>o</i>-nitrophenol and <i>p</i>-toluidine
  do not combine with one another.</p>

  <p>In connection with this curve, attention may be called to the
  interesting fact that although the solid produced by cooling the liquid
  phase at the eutectic point has a composition approximating to that of a
  compound of equimolecular proportions of the phenol and toluidine, and a
  constant melting point, it is nevertheless a <i>mixture</i>. Although, as
  a rule, the constituents of the eutectic mixture are not present in
  simple molecular proportions, there is no reason why they should not be
  so; and it is therefore necessary to beware of assuming the formation of
  compounds in such cases.<a name="NtA293"
  href="#Nt293"><sup>[293]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Fig. 67, on the other hand, indicates with perfect certainty the
  formation of a compound between phenol and <span
  class="grk">&alpha;</span>-naphthylamine.<a name="NtA294"
  href="#Nt294"><sup>[294]</sup></a> (<i>Cf.</i> curve I., Fig. 64.)</p>

  <p>Phenol freezes at 40.4°, but the addition of <span
  class="grk">&alpha;</span>-naphthylamine lowers the freezing point as
  represented by the curve AC. At C (16.0°) the compound
  C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH,C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>7</sub>NH<sub>2</sub> is
  formed, and the system becomes invariant. On increasing the amount of the
  amine, the temperature of equilibrium rises, the solid phase now being
  the compound. At D, the curve passes through a maximum (28.8°), at which
  the solid and liquid phases have the same composition. This is the
  melting point of the compound. Further addition of the amine lowers the
  temperature of equilibrium, until at E solid <span
  class="grk">&alpha;</span>-naphthylamine separates out, and a second
  eutectic point (24.0°) is obtained. BE is the <!-- Page 214 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page214"></a>{214}</span>freezing-point curve of
  <span class="grk">&alpha;</span>-naphthylamine in presence of phenol, the
  freezing point of the pure amine being 48.3°.</p>

  <p>On account of the great sluggishness with which the compound of phenol
  and <span class="grk">&alpha;</span>-naphthylamine crystallizes, it was
  found possible to follow the freezing point curves of phenol and the
  amine to temperatures considerably below the eutectic points, as shown by
  the curves CF and EG.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:45%;">
      <a href="images/fig067.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig067.png"
      alt="Fig. 67" title="Fig. 67" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 67.
  </div>

  <p>Phenol can also combine with <i>p</i>-toluidine in equimolecular
  proportions; and this compound is of interest, from the fact that it
  exists in two crystalline forms melting at 28.5° and 30°. Each of these
  forms now must have its own equilibrium curve, and it was found that the
  intermediate portion of the freezing point curve was duplicated, as shown
  in Fig. 68.<a name="NtA295" href="#Nt295"><sup>[295]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 215 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page215"></a>{215}</span></p>

  <p>Lastly, a curve is given, Fig. 69,<a name="NtA296"
  href="#Nt296"><sup>[296]</sup></a> which corresponds with curve II., Fig.
  64. Picric acid and benzene can form a compound, which, however, can
  exist only in contact with solutions <i>containing excess of benzene</i>.
  When the temperature is raised, a point (K) is reached at which the
  compound melts with separation of solid picric acid. The point, K, is,
  therefore, a <i>transition point</i>; analysis, however, showed that the
  composition of the solution at this point is very nearly that of the
  compound
  C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>2</sub>(NO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>OH,C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>,
  so that the melting point of the compound can almost be reached. The
  fusion of the compound of benzene and picric acid with separation of the
  latter is analogous to the (partial) fusion of Glauber's salt with
  separation of anhydrous sodium sulphate.</p>

<p class="cenhead">2. <i>Optically Active Substances.</i></p>

  <p>The question as to whether a resolvable inactive body is a mixture of
  the two oppositely active constituents (a <i>dl</i>-mixture), or a
  racemic compound, is one which has given rise to considerable discussion
  during the past decade; and several investigators have endeavoured to
  establish general rules by which the question could be decided. In the
  case of inactive liquids it is a matter of great difficulty to arrive at
  a certain conclusion as to whether one is dealing with a mixture or a
  compound, for in this case the usual physical methods give but a dubious
  answer; and although the existence of a racemate in the liquid state (in
  the case of conine) has been asserted,<a name="NtA297"
  href="#Nt297"><sup>[297]</sup></a> most chemists incline to the belief
  that such a thing is improbable.</p>

  <p>Even in the case of crystalline substances, where the differences
  between the various forms is greater, it was not always easy to
  discriminate between the <i>dl</i>-mixture and the racemic compound. The
  occurrence of hemihedral faces was considered by Pasteur to be a
  sufficient criterion for an optically active substance. It has, however,
  been found that hemihedry in crystals, although a frequent accompaniment
  of <!-- Page 217 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page217"></a>{217}</span>optical activity, is by no means a
  necessary or constant expression of this property. Other rules, also,
  which were given, although in some cases reliable, were in other cases
  insufficient; and all were in so far unsatisfactory that they lacked a
  theoretical basis.</p>

  <p>With the help of the Phase Rule, however, it is possible from a study
  of the solubility or fusion curves of the optically active and inactive
  substances, to decide the nature of the inactive substance, at least
  under certain conditions. On account of the interest and importance which
  these compounds possess, a brief description of the application of the
  Phase Rule to the study of such substances will be given here;<a
  name="NtA298" href="#Nt298"><sup>[298]</sup></a> the two optical
  antipodes being regarded as the two components.</p>

  <p>In the present chapter we shall consider only the fusion curves, the
  solubility curves being discussed in the next section on three-component
  systems. The rules which are hereby obtained, have reference only to the
  nature of the inactive substance in the neighbourhood of the melting
  points.</p>

  <p>I. <i>The inactive substance is a </i>dl<i>-mixture.</i></p>

  <p>In this case the fusion curves will have the simple form shown in type
  I, Fig. 63. A and B are the melting points of the two optical isomerides,
  and C the eutectic point at which the inactive mixture consisting of
  equal amounts of d- and l-form melts. Owing to the similar effect of the
  one form on the freezing point of the other, the figure is symmetrical.
  No example of this simple case has been investigated.</p>

  <p>II. <i>The two components form a racemic compound.</i></p>

  <p>In this case there will be three melting point curves as in Fig. 64,
  type I. In this case also the figure must be symmetrical.</p>

  <p><b>Examples.</b>&mdash;As examples of this, may be taken dimethyl
  tartrate and mandelic acid, the freezing point curves of which are given
  in Figs. 70 and 71.<a name="NtA299" href="#Nt299"><sup>[299]</sup></a> As
  can be seen, the curve for the racemic tartrate occupies a large part of
  the diagram, <!-- Page 218 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page218"></a>{218}</span>while that for racemic mandelic acid is
  much smaller. In the case of dimethyldiacetyl tartrate, this middle
  portion is still less.</p>

  <div class="figleft" style="width:20%;">
      <a href="images/fig070.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig070.png"
      alt="Fig. 70" title="Fig. 70" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 70.
  </div>

  <div class="figleft" style="width:19%;">
      <a href="images/fig071.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig071.png"
      alt="Fig. 71" title="Fig. 71" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 71.
  </div>

  <div class="figleft" style="width:43%;">
      <a href="images/fig072.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig072.png"
      alt="Fig. 72" title="Fig. 72" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 72.
  </div>

<div style="clear: both"></div>
  <p>Active dimethyl tartrate melts at 43.3°; racemic dimethyl tartrate at
  89.4°. Active mandelic acid melts at 132.8°; the racemic acid at 118.0°.
  In the one case, therefore, the racemic compound has a higher, in the
  other a lower melting point than the active forms. <!-- Page 219 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page219"></a>{219}</span></p>

  <p>In the case of partially racemic compounds (<i>i.e.</i> the compound
  of a racemate with an optically active substance) the type of curve will
  be the same, but the figure will no longer be symmetrical. Such a curve
  has been found in the case of the l-menthyl esters of d- and l-mandelic
  acid (Fig. 72).<a name="NtA300" href="#Nt300"><sup>[300]</sup></a> The
  freezing point of l-menthyl d-mandelate is 97.2°, of l-menthyl
  l-mandelate 77.6°, and of l-menthyl r-mandelate 83.7.° It will be
  observed that the summit of the curve for the partially racemic mandelate
  is very flat, indicating that the compound is largely dissociated into
  its components at the temperature of fusion.</p>

  <p>III. <i>The inactive substance is a pseudo-racemic mixed
  crystal.</i></p>

  <p>In cases where the active components can form mixed crystals, the
  freezing-point curve will exhibit one of the forms given in Fig. 65. The
  inactive mixed crystal containing 50 per cent. of the dextro and laevo
  compound, is known as a pseudo-racemic mixed crystal.<a name="NtA301"
  href="#Nt301"><sup>[301]</sup></a> So far, only curves of the types I.
  and II. have been obtained.</p>

  <p><b>Examples.</b>&mdash;The two active camphor oximes are of interest
  from the fact that they form a continuous series of mixed crystals,
  <i>all of which have the same melting point</i>. The curve which is
  obtained in this case is, therefore, a straight line joining the melting
  points of the pure active components; the melting point of the active
  isomerides and of the whole series of mixed crystals being 118.8°.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:19%;">
      <a href="images/fig073.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig073.png"
      alt="Fig. 73" title="Fig. 73" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 73.
  </div>

  <p>In the case of the carvoximes mixed crystals are also formed, but the
  equilibrium curve in this case exhibits a maximum (Fig. 73). At this
  maximum point the composition of the solid and of the liquid solution is
  the same. Since the curve must be symmetrical, this maximum point must
  occur in the case of the solution containing 50 per cent. <!-- Page 220
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page220"></a>{220}</span>of each
  component, which will therefore be inactive. Further, this inactive mixed
  crystal will melt and solidify at the same temperature, and behave,
  therefore, like a chemical compound (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page187">187</a>). The
  melting point of the active compounds is 72°; that of the inactive
  pseudo-racemic mixed crystal is 91.4°·</p>

  <p><b>Transformations.</b>&mdash;As has already been remarked, the
  conclusions which can be drawn from the fusion curves regarding the
  nature of the inactive substances formed hold only for temperatures in
  the neighbourhood of the melting points. At temperatures below the
  melting point transformation may occur; <i>e.g.</i> a racemate may break
  up into a <i>dl</i>-mixture, or a pseudo-racemic mixed crystal may form a
  racemic compound. We shall at a later point meet with examples of a
  racemic compound changing into a <i>dl</i>-mixture at a definite
  transition point; and the pseudo-racemic mixed crystal of camphoroxime is
  an example of the second transformation. Although at temperatures in the
  neighbourhood of the melting point the two active camphoroximes form only
  mixed crystals but no compound, a racemic compound is formed at
  temperatures below 103°. At this temperature the inactive pseudo-racemic
  mixed crystal changes into a racemic compound; and in the case of the
  other mixed crystals transformation to racemate and (excess of) active
  component also occurs, although at a lower temperature than in the case
  of the inactive mixed crystal. Although this behaviour is one of
  considerable importance, this brief reference to it must suffice here.<a
  name="NtA302" href="#Nt302"><sup>[302]</sup></a></p>

<p class="cenhead">3. <i>Alloys.</i></p>

  <p>One of the most important classes of substances in the study of which
  the Phase Rule has been of very considerable importance, is that formed
  by the mixtures or compounds of metals with one another known as alloys.
  Although in the investigation of the nature of these bodies various
  methods are employed, one of the most important is the determination of
  the character of the freezing-point curve; for from the form of this,
  valuable information can, as we have already learned, be <!-- Page 221
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page221"></a>{221}</span>obtained
  regarding the nature of the solid substances which separate out from the
  molten mixture.</p>

  <p>Although it is impossible here to discuss fully the experimental
  results and the oftentimes very complicated relationships which the study
  of the alloys has brought to light, a brief reference to these bodies
  will be advisable on account both of the scientific interest and of the
  industrial importance attaching to them.<a name="NtA303"
  href="#Nt303"><sup>[303]</sup></a></p>

  <p>We have already seen that there are three chief types of
  freezing-point curves in systems of two components, viz. those obtained
  when (1) the pure components crystallize out from the molten mass; (2)
  the components form one or more compounds; (3) the components form mixed
  crystals. In the case of the metals, representatives of these three
  classes are also found.</p>

  <p>1. <i>The components separate out in the pure state.</i></p>

  <p>In this case the freezing-point curve is of the simple type, Fig. 63,
  I. Such curves have been obtained in the case of a number of pairs of
  metals, <i>e.g.</i> zinc&mdash;cadmium, zinc&mdash;aluminium,
  copper&mdash;silver (Heycock and Neville), tin&mdash;zinc,
  bismuth&mdash;lead (Gautier), and in other cases. From molten mixtures
  represented by one branch of the freezing-point curve one of the metals
  will be deposited; while from mixtures represented by the other branch,
  the other metal will separate out. At the eutectic point the molten mass
  will solidify to a <i>heterogeneous mixture</i> of the two metals,
  forming what is known as the <i>eutectic alloy</i>. Such an alloy,
  therefore, will melt at a definite temperature lower than the melting
  point of either of the pure metals.</p>

<p><!-- Page 222 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page222"></a>{222}</span></p>

  <p>In the following table are given the temperature and the composition
  of the liquid at the eutectic point, for three pairs of
  metals:&mdash;</p>

</table>

  <p>The melting points of the pure metals are, zinc, 419°; cadmium, 322°;
  silver, 960°; copper, 1081°; aluminium, 650°.</p>

  <p>2. <i>The two metals can form one or more compounds.</i></p>

  <p>In this case there will be obtained not only the freezing-point curves
  of the pure metals, but each compound formed will have its own
  freezing-point curve, exhibiting a point of maximum temperature, and
  ending on either side in an eutectic point. The simplest curve of this
  type will be obtained when only one compound is formed, as is the case
  with mercury and thallium.<a name="NtA304"

  <p>A curve belonging to the same type, but more complicated, is obtained
  with gold and aluminium;<a name="NtA306"
  href="#Nt306"><sup>[306]</sup></a> in this case, several compounds are
  formed, some of which have a definite melting point, while others exhibit
  only a transition point. The chief compound is AuAl<sub>2</sub>, which
  has practically the same melting point as pure gold.</p>

  <p>3. <i>The two metals form mixed crystals (solid solutions).</i></p>

  <p>The simplest case in which the metals crystallize out together is
  found in silver and gold.<a name="NtA307"
  href="#Nt307"><sup>[307]</sup></a> The freezing-point curve in this case
  is an almost straight line joining the freezing points of the pure metals
  (<i>cf.</i> curve I., Fig. 65, p.&nbsp;<a href="#page210">210</a>). These two
  metals, therefore, can form an unbroken series of mixed crystals.</p>

  <p>In some cases, however, the two metals do not form an unbroken series
  of mixed crystals. In the case of zinc and silver,<a name="NtA308"
  href="#Nt308"><sup>[308]</sup></a> for example, the addition of silver
  <i>raises</i> the freezing point of the mixture, until a transition point
  is reached. This corresponds with curve IV., Fig. 65. Silver and copper,
  and gold and copper, on the other hand, do not form unbroken series of
  mixed crystals, but the freezing-point curve exhibits an eutectic point,
  as in curve V., Fig. 65.</p>

  <p>Not only may there be these three different types of curves, but there
  may also be combinations of these. Thus the two metals may not only form
  compounds, but one of the metals may not separate out in the pure state
  at all, but form mixed crystals. In this case the freezing point may rise
  (as in the case of silver and zinc), and one of the eutectic points will
  be absent.</p>

  <p><b>Iron-Carbon Alloys.</b>&mdash;Of all the different binary alloys,
  probably the most important are those formed by iron and carbon: alloys
  consisting not of two metals, but of a metal and a non-metal. On account
  of the importance of these alloys, an attempt will be made to describe in
  brief some of the most important relationships met with.</p>

  <p>Before proceeding to discuss the applications of the Phase Rule to the
  study of the iron-carbon alloys, however, the main <!-- Page 224 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page224"></a>{224}</span>facts with which we
  have to deal may be stated very briefly. With regard to the metal itself,
  it is known to exist in three different allotropic modifications, called
  <span class="grk">&alpha;</span>-, <span class="grk">&beta;</span>-, and
  <span class="grk">&gamma;</span>-ferrite respectively. Like the two
  modifications of sulphur and of tin, these different forms exhibit
  transition points at which the relative stability of the forms changes.
  Thus the transition point for <span class="grk">&alpha;</span>- and <span
  class="grk">&beta;</span>-ferrite is about 780°; and below this
  temperature the <span class="grk">&alpha;</span>- form, above it the
  <span class="grk">&beta;</span>- form is stable. For <span
  class="grk">&beta;</span>- and <span class="grk">&gamma;</span>-ferrite,
  the transition point is about 870°, the <span class="grk">&gamma;</span>-
  form being the stable modification above this temperature.</p>

  <p>The different modifications of iron also possess different properties.
  Thus, <span class="grk">&alpha;</span>-ferrite is magnetic, but does not
  possess the power of dissolving carbon; <span
  class="grk">&beta;</span>-ferrite is non-magnetic, and likewise does not
  dissolve carbon; <span class="grk">&gamma;</span>-ferrite is also
  non-magnetic, but possesses the power of dissolving carbon, and of thus
  giving rise to solid solutions of carbon in iron.</p>

  <p>Various alloys of iron and carbon, also, have to be distinguished.
  First of all, there is <i>hard steel</i>, which contains varying amounts
  of carbon up to 2 per cent. Microscopic examination shows that these
  mixtures are all homogeneous; and they are therefore to be regarded as
  solid solutions of carbon in iron (<span
  class="grk">&gamma;</span>-ferrite). To these solutions the name
  <i>martensite</i> has been given. <i>Pearlite</i> contains about 0.8 per
  cent. of carbon, and, on microscopic examination, is found to be a
  heterogeneous mixture. If heated above 670°, pearlite becomes
  homogeneous, and forms martensite. Lastly, there is a definite compound
  of iron and carbon, iron carbide or <i>cementite</i>, having the formula
  Fe<sub>3</sub>C.</p>

  <p>A short description may now be given of the application of the Phase
  Rule to the two-component system iron&mdash;carbon; and of the diagram
  showing how the different systems are related, and with the help of which
  the behaviour of the different mixtures under given conditions can be
  predicted. Although, with regard to the main features of this diagram,
  the different areas to be mapped and the position of the frontier lines,
  there is general agreement; a final decision has not yet been reached
  with regard to the interpretation to be put on all the curves.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:44%;">
      <a href="images/fig075.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig075.png"

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 75.
  </div>

  <p>The chief relationships met with in the case of the <!-- Page 225
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page225"></a>{225}</span>iron-carbon
  alloys are represented graphically in Fig. 75.<a name="NtA309"
  href="#Nt309"><sup>[309]</sup></a> The curve AC is the freezing-point
  curve for iron,<a name="NtA310" href="#Nt310"><sup>[310]</sup></a> BC the
  unknown freezing-point curve for graphite. C is an <span
  class="correction" title="Original reads 'eutetic'.">eutectic</span>
  point. Suppose, now, that we start with a mixture of iron and carbon,
  represented by the point <i>x</i>. On lowering the temperature, a point,
  <i>y</i>, will be reached at which solid begins to separate out. This
  solid phase, however, is not pure iron, but a solid solution of carbon in
  iron, having the composition represented by <i>y&prime;</i> (cf. p.&nbsp;<a
  href="#page185">185</a>). As the temperature continues to fall, the <!--
  Page 226 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page226"></a>{226}</span>composition of the liquid phase changes in
  the direction of <i>y</i>C, while the composition of the solid which
  separates out changes in the direction <i>y&prime;</i>D; and, finally,
  when the composition of the molten mass is that of the point C (4.3 per
  cent. of carbon), the whole mass solidifies to a heterogeneous mixture of
  two solid solutions, one of which is represented by D (containing 2 per
  cent. of carbon), while the other will consist practically of pure
  graphite, and is not shown in the figure. The temperature of the eutectic
  point is 1130°.</p>

  <p>Even below the solidification point, however, changes can take place.
  As has been said, the solid phase which finally separates out from the
  molten mass is a solid solution represented by the point D; and the curve
  DE represents the change in the composition of this solid solution with
  the temperature. As indicated in the figure, DE forms a part of a curve
  representing the mutual solubility of graphite in iron and iron in
  graphite; the latter solutions, however, not being shown, as they would
  lie far outside the diagram. As the temperature falls below 1130°, more
  and more graphite separates out, until at E, when the temperature is
  1000°, the solid solution contains only 1.8 per cent. of carbon. At this
  temperature cementite also begins to be formed, so that as the
  temperature continues to fall, separation of cementite (represented by
  the line E&prime;F&prime;) occurs, and the composition of the solid
  solution undergoes alteration, as represented by the curve EF. Below the
  temperature of the point F (670°) the martensite becomes heterogeneous,
  and forms pearlite.</p>

  <p>From the above description, therefore, it follows that if we start
  with a molten mixture of iron and carbon, the composition of which is
  represented by any point between D and C (from 2 to 4.3 per cent. of
  carbon), we shall obtain, on cooling the mass, first of all solid
  solutions, the composition of which will be represented by points on the
  line AD; that then, after the mass has completely solidified at 1130°,
  further cooling will lead to a separation of graphite and a change in the
  composition of the martensite (from 2 to 1.8 per cent. of carbon). On
  cooling below 1000°, however, the martensite and graphite will give rise
  to cementite and solid solutions <!-- Page 227 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page227"></a>{227}</span>containing less carbon
  than before, until, at temperatures below 670°, we are left with a
  mixture of pearlite and cementite.</p>

  <p>We have already said that iron consists in three allotropic
  modifications, the regions of stability of which are separated by
  definite transition points. The transition point for <span
  class="grk">&alpha;</span>- and <span class="grk">&beta;</span>-ferrite
  (780°) is represented in Fig. 75 by the point H; and the transition point
  for <span class="grk">&beta;</span>- and <span
  class="grk">&gamma;</span>-ferrite (870°) by the point I. Since neither
  the <span class="grk">&alpha;</span>- nor the <span
  class="grk">&beta;</span>-ferrite dissolves carbon, the transition point
  will be unaffected by addition of carbon, and we therefore obtain the
  horizontal transition curve HG. In the case of the <span
  class="grk">&beta;</span>- and <span class="grk">&gamma;</span>-ferrite,
  however, the latter dissolves carbon, and the transition point is
  consequently affected by the amount of carbon present. This is shown by
  the line IG.</p>

  <p>If a martensite containing less carbon than that represented by the
  point G is cooled down from a temperature of, say, 900°, then when the
  temperature has fallen to that, represented by a point on the curve IG,
  <span class="grk">&beta;</span>-ferrite will separate out, and, as the
  temperature falls, the composition of the solid solution will alter as
  represented by IG. On passing below the temperature of HG, the <span
  class="grk">&beta;</span>-ferrite will be converted into <span
  class="grk">&alpha;</span>-ferrite, and, as the temperature falls, the
  latter will separate out more and more, while the composition of the
  solid solution alters in the direction GF. On passing to still lower
  temperatures, the solid solution at F (0.8 per cent. of carbon) breaks up
  into pearlite. If the percentage of carbon in the original solid solution
  was between that represented by the points G and F, then, on cooling
  down, no <span class="grk">&beta;</span>-ferrite, but only <span
  class="grk">&alpha;</span>-ferrite would separate out.</p>

  <p>We see, therefore, that when martensite is allowed to cool
  <i>slowly</i>, it yields a heterogeneous mixture either of ferrite and
  pearlite (when the original mixture contained up to 0.8 per cent. of
  carbon), or pearlite and cementite (when the original mixture contained
  between 0.8 and 2 per cent. of carbon). These heterogeneous mixtures
  constitute soft steels, or, when the carbon content is low, wrought
  iron.</p>

  <p>The case, however, is different if the solid solution of carbon in
  iron is <i>rapidly</i> cooled (quenched) from a temperature above the
  curve IGFE to a temperature below this <!-- Page 228 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page228"></a>{228}</span>curve. In this case,
  the rapid cooling does not allow time for the various changes which have
  been described to take place; so that the homogeneous solid solution, on
  being rapidly cooled, remains homogeneous. In this way hard steel is
  obtained. By varying the rapidity of cooling, as is done in the tempering
  of steel, varying degrees of hardness can be obtained.</p>

  <p>The interpretation of the curves given above is that due essentially
  to Roozeboom, who concluded from the experimental data that at
  temperatures below 1000° the stable systems are martensite and cementite,
  or ferrite and cementite, graphite being labile. It has, however, been
  pointed out, more especially by E. Heyn,<a name="NtA311"
  href="#Nt311"><sup>[311]</sup></a> that this is not in harmony with the
  facts of metallurgy, which show that graphite is undoubtedly formed on
  slow cooling, and more especially when small quantities of silicon are
  present in the iron.<a name="NtA312" href="#Nt312"><sup>[312]</sup></a>
  While, therefore, the relationships represented by Fig. 75 are obtained
  under certain conditions (especially when manganese is present), Heyn
  considers that all the curves in that figure, except ACB, represent
  <i>metastable</i> systems&mdash;systems, therefore, akin to supercooled
  liquids. Rapid cooling will favour the production of the metastable
  systems containing cementite, and therefore give rise to relationships
  represented by Fig. 75; whereas slow cooling will lead to the stable
  system ferrite and graphite. Presence of silicon tends to prevent,
  presence of manganese tends to assist, the production of the metastable
  systems.</p>

  <p><span class="correction" title="Original reads 'Athough'."
  >Although</span> this view put forward by Heyn has not been conclusively
  proved, it must be said that there is much evidence in its favour.
  Further investigation is, however, required before a final decision as to
  the interpretation of the curves can be reached.</p>

  <p><b>Determination of the Composition of Compounds, without
  Analysis.</b>&mdash;Since the equilibrium between a solid and a liquid
  phase depends not only on the composition of the liquid (solution) but
  also on that of the solid, it is necessary <!-- Page 229 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page229"></a>{229}</span>to determine the
  composition of the latter. In some cases this is easily effected by
  separating the solid from the liquid phase and analyzing it. In other
  cases, however, this method is inapplicable, or is accompanied by
  difficulties, due either to the fact that the solid phase undergoes
  decomposition (<i>e.g.</i> when it contains a volatile constituent), or
  to the difficulty of completely separating the mother liquor; as, for
  example, in the case of alloys. In all such cases, therefore, recourse
  must be had to other methods.</p>

  <p>In the first place, synthetic methods may be employed.<a name="NtA313"
  href="#Nt313"><sup>[313]</sup></a> In this case we start with a solution
  of the two components, to which a third substance is added, which,
  however, does not enter into the solid phase.<a name="NtA314"
  href="#Nt314"><sup>[314]</sup></a> We will assume that the initial
  solution contains <i>x</i> gm. of A and <i>y</i> gm. of B to 1 gm. of C.
  After the solution has been cooled down to such a temperature that solid
  substance separates out, a portion of the liquid phase is removed with a
  pipette and analyzed. If, now, the composition of the solution is such
  that there are <i>x&prime;</i> gm. of A and <i>y&prime;</i> gm. of B to 1
  gm. of C., then the composition of the solid phase is <i>x</i> -
  <i>x&prime;</i> gm. of A and <i>y</i> - <i>y&prime;</i> gm. of B. When
  <i>x</i> = <i>x&prime;</i>, the solid phase is pure B; when <i>y</i> =
  <i>y&prime;</i>, the solid phase is pure A.</p>

  <p>We have assumed here that there is only one solid phase present,
  containing A and B. To make sure that the solid phase is not a solid
  solution in which A and B are present in the same ratio as in the liquid
  solution, a second determination of the composition must be made, with
  different initial and end concentrations. If the solid phase is a solid
  solution, the composition will now be found different from that found
  previously.</p>

  <p>The composition of the solid phase can, however, be determined in
  another manner, viz. by studying the fusion curve and the curve of
  cooling. From the form of the fusion curve alone, it is possible to
  decide whether the two components <!-- Page 230 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page230"></a>{230}</span>form a compound or not;
  and if the compounds which may be formed have a definite melting point,
  the position of the latter gives at once the composition of the compounds
  (cf. p.&nbsp;<a href="#page231">231</a>).</p>

  <p>This method, however, cannot be applied when the compounds undergo
  decomposition before the melting point is reached. In such cases,
  however, the form of the cooling curve enables one to decide the
  composition of the solid phase.<a name="NtA315"
  href="#Nt315"><sup>[315]</sup></a> If a solution is allowed to cool
  slowly, and the temperature noted at definite times, the graphic
  representation of the rate of cooling will give a continuous curve;
  <i>e.g.</i> <i>ab</i> in Fig. 76. So soon, however, as a solid phase
  begins to be formed, the rate of cooling alters abruptly, and the cooling
  curve then exhibits a break, or change in direction (point <i>b</i>).
  When the eutectic point is reached, the temperature remains constant,
  until all the liquid has solidified. This is represented by the line
  <i>cd</i>. When complete solidification has occurred, the fall of
  temperature again becomes uniform (<i>de</i>).</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:16%;">
      <a href="images/fig076.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig076.png"
      alt="Fig. 76" title="Fig. 76" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 76.
  </div>

  <div class="figright" style="width:17%;">
      <a href="images/fig078.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig078.png"

      alt="Fig. 77" title="Fig. 77" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 77.
  </div>

  <p>The length of time during which the temperature remains constant at
  the point <i>c</i>, depends, of course, on the eutectic solution. If,
  therefore, we take equal amounts of solution having a different initial
  composition, the period of constant temperature in the cooling curve will
  evidently be greatest in the case of the solution having the composition
  of the eutectic point; and the period will become less and less as we
  increase the amount of one of the components. The relationship between
  initial composition of solution and the duration of constant temperature
  at the eutectic point is represented by the curve
  <i>a&prime;c&prime;b&prime;</i> (Fig. 77). When a compound possessing a
  definite melting point is formed, it behaves as a pure substance. If,
  therefore, the initial composition of the <!-- Page 231 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page231"></a>{231}</span>solution is the same as
  that of the compound, no eutectic solution will be obtained; and
  therefore no line of constant temperature, such as <i>cd</i> (Fig. 76).
  In such a case, if we represent graphically the relation between the
  initial composition of the solution and the duration of constant
  temperature, a diagram is obtained such as shown in Fig. 78. The two
  maxima on the time-composition curve represent eutectic points, and the
  minima, <i>a&prime;</i>, <i>b&prime;</i>, <i>e&prime;</i>, pure
  substances. The position of <i>e&prime;</i> gives the composition of the
  compound. When a series of compounds is formed, then for each compound a
  minimum is found on the time-composition curve.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:17%;">
      <a href="images/fig079.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig079.png"
      alt="Fig. 79" title="Fig. 79" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 79.
  </div>

  <p>If the compound formed has no definite melting point, the diagram
  obtained is like that shown in Fig. 79. If we start with a solution, the
  composition of which is represented by a point between <i>d</i> and
  <i>b</i>, then, on cooling, <i>b</i> will separate out first, and the
  temperature will fall until the point <i>d</i> is reached. The
  temperature then remains constant until the component <i>b</i>, which has
  separated out, is converted into the compound. After this the temperature
  again falls, until it again remains constant at the eutectic point
  <i>c</i>. In the case of the first halt, the period of constant
  temperature is greatest when the initial composition of the solution is
  the same as that of the compound; and it becomes shorter and shorter with
  <!-- Page 232 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page232"></a>{232}</span>increase in the amount of either
  component. In this way we obtain the time-composition curve
  <i>b&prime;e&Prime;d&prime;</i>, of which the maximum point
  <i>e&Prime;</i> gives the composition of the compound.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, the period of constant temperature for the eutectic
  point <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'e'."
  ><i>c</i></span> is greatest in the case of solutions having the same
  initial <i>composition</i> as that corresponding with the eutectic point;
  and it decreases the more the initial composition approaches that of the
  pure component <i>a</i> or the component <i>e</i>. In this way we obtain
  the time-composition curve <i>a&prime;c&prime;e&prime;</i>. Here also the
  point <i>e&prime;</i> represents the composition of the compound. We see,
  therefore, that from the graphic representation of the freezing-point
  curve, and from the duration of the temperature-arrests on the cooling
  curve, for solutions of different initial composition, it is possible,
  without having recourse to analysis, to decide what solid phases are
  formed, and what is their composition.</p>

  <p><b>Formation of Minerals.</b>&mdash;Important and interesting as is
  the application of the Phase Rule to the study of alloys, its application
  to the study of the conditions regulating the formation of minerals is no
  less so; and although we do not propose to consider different cases in
  detail here, still attention must be drawn to certain points connected
  with this interesting subject.</p>

  <p>In the first place, it will be evident from what has already been
  said, that that mineral which first crystallizes out from a molten magma
  is not necessarily the one with the highest melting point. The
  <i>composition</i> of the fused mass must be taken into account. When the
  system consists of two components which do not form a compound, one or
  other of these will separate out in a pure state, according as the
  composition of the molten mass lies on one or other side of the eutectic
  composition; and the separation of the one component will continue until
  the composition of the eutectic point is reached. Further cooling will
  then lead to the simultaneous separation of the two components.</p>

  <p>If, however, the two components form a stable compound (<i>e.g.</i>
  orthoclase, from a fused mixture of silica and potassium aluminate), then
  the freezing-point curve will resemble that <!-- Page 233 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page233"></a>{233}</span>shown in Fig. 64;
  <i>i.e.</i> there will be a middle curve possessing a dystectic point,
  and ending on either side at a eutectic point. This curve would represent
  the conditions under which orthoclase is in equilibrium with the molten
  magma. If the initial composition of the magma is represented by a point
  between the two eutectic points, orthoclase will separate first. The
  composition of the magma will thereby change, and the mass will finally
  solidify to a mixture of orthoclase and silica, or orthoclase and
  potassium aluminate, according to the initial composition.</p>

  <p>What has just been said holds, however, only for stable equilibria,
  and it must not be forgotten that complications can arise owing to
  suspended transformation (when, for example, the magma is rapidly cooled)
  and the production of metastable equilibria. These conditions occur very
  frequently in nature.</p>

  <p>The study of the formation of minerals from the point of view of the
  Phase Rule is still in its initial stages, but the results which have
  already been obtained give promise of a rich harvest in the future.<a

<h3>CHAPTER XIII</h3>

<p class="cenhead">SYSTEMS OF THREE COMPONENTS</p>

  <p><b>General.</b>&mdash;It has already been made evident that an
  increase in the number of the components from one to two gives rise to a
  considerable increase in the possible number of systems, and introduces
  not a few complications into the equilibrium relations of these. No less
  is this the case when the number of components increases from two to
  three; and although examples of all the possible types of systems of
  three components have not been investigated, nor, indeed, any one type
  fully, nevertheless, among the systems which have been studied
  experimentally, cases occur which not only possess a high scientific
  interest, but are also of great industrial importance. On account not
  only of the number, but more especially of the complexity of the systems
  constituted of three components, no attempt will be made to give a full
  account, or, indeed, even a survey of all the cases which have been
  subjected to a more or less complete experimental investigation; on the
  contrary, only a few of the more important classes will be selected, and
  the most important points in connection with the behaviour of these
  described.</p>

  <p>On applying the Phase Rule</p>

<p class="cenhead">P + F = C + 2</p>

  <p>to the systems of three components, we see that in order that the
  system shall be invariant, no fewer than five phases must be present
  together, and an invariant system will therefore exist at a
  <i>quintuple</i> point. Since the number of liquid phases can never
  exceed the number of the components, and since there can be only one
  vapour phase, it is evident that in this case, <!-- Page 235 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page235"></a>{235}</span>as in others, there
  must always be at least one solid phase present at the quintuple point.
  As the number of phases diminishes, the variability of the system can
  increase from one to four, so that in the last case the condition of the
  system will not be completely defined until not only the temperature and
  the total pressure of the system, but also the concentrations of two of
  the components have been fixed. Or, instead of the concentrations, the
  partial pressures of the components may also be taken as independent
  variables.</p>

  <p><b>Graphic Representation.</b>&mdash;Hitherto the concentrations of
  the components have been represented by means of rectangular
  co-ordinates, although the numerical relationships have been expressed in
  two different ways. In the one case, the concentration of the one
  component was expressed in terms of a fixed amount of the other
  component. Thus, the solubility of a salt was expressed by the number of
  grams of salt dissolved by 100 grams of water or other solvent; and the
  numbers so obtained were measured along one of the co-ordinates. The
  second co-ordinate was then employed to indicate the change of another
  independent variable, <i>e.g.</i> temperature. In the other case, the
  combined weights of the two components A and B were put equal to unity,
  and the concentration of the one expressed as a fraction of the whole
  amount. This method allows of the representation of the complete series
  of concentrations, from pure A to pure B, and was employed, for example,
  in the graphic representation of the freezing point curves.</p>

  <p>Even in the case of three components rectangular co-ordinates can also
  be employed, and, indeed, are the most convenient in those cases where
  the behaviour of two of the components to one another is very different
  from their behaviour to the third component; as, for example, in the case
  of two salts and water. In these cases, the composition of the system can
  be represented by measuring the amounts of each of the two components in
  a given weight of the third, along two co-ordinates at right angles to
  one another; and the change of the system with the temperature can then
  be represented by a third axis at right angles to the first two. In those
  cases, <!-- Page 236 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page236"></a>{236}</span>however, where the three components behave
  in much the same manner towards one another, the rectangular co-ordinates
  are not at all suitable, and instead of these a <i>triangular diagram</i>
  is employed. Various methods have been proposed for the graphic
  representation of systems of three components by means of a triangle, but
  only two of these have been employed to any considerable extent; and a
  short description of these two methods will therefore suffice.<a
  name="NtA317" href="#Nt317"><sup>[317]</sup></a></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:39%;">

    <span class="sc">Fig. 80.</span>
  </div>

  <p>In the method proposed by Gibbs an equilateral triangle of unit height
  is used (Fig 80).<a name="NtA318" href="#Nt318"><sup>[318]</sup></a> The
  quantities of the different components are expressed as fractional parts
  of the whole, and the sum of their concentrations is therefore equal to
  unity, and can be represented by the height of the triangle. The corners
  <!-- Page 237 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page237"></a>{237}</span>of the triangle represent the pure
  substances A, B, and C respectively. A point on one of the sides of the
  triangle will give the composition of a mixture in which only two
  components are present, while a point within the triangle will represent
  the composition of a ternary mixture. Since every point within the
  triangle has the property that the sum of the perpendiculars from that
  point on the sides of the triangle is equal to unity (the height of the
  triangle), it is evident that the composition of a ternary mixture can be
  represented by fixing a point within the triangle such that the lengths
  of the <i>perpendiculars</i> from the point to the sides of the triangle
  are equal respectively to the fractional amounts of the three components
  present; the fractional amount of A, B, or C being represented by the
  perpendicular distance from the side of the triangle <i>opposite</i> the
  corners A, B, and C respectively.</p>

  <p>The location of this point is simplified by dividing the normals from
  each of the corners on the opposite side into ten or one hundred parts,
  and drawing through these divisions lines at right angles to the normal
  and parallel to the side of the triangle. A network of rhombohedra is
  thus obtained, and the position of any point can be read off in
  practically the same manner as in the case of rectangular co-ordinates.
  Thus the point P in Fig. 80 represents a ternary mixture of the
  composition A = 0.5, B = 0.3, C = 0.2; the perpendiculars P<i>a</i>,
  P<i>b</i>, and P<i>c</i> being equal respectively to 0.5, 0.2, and 0.3 of
  the height of the triangle.</p>

  <p>Another method of representation, due to Roozeboom, consists in
  employing an equilateral triangle, the length of whose <i>side</i> is
  made equal to unity, or one hundred; the sum of the fractional or
  percentage amounts of the three components being represented therefore by
  a side of the triangle. In this case the composition of a ternary mixture
  is obtained by determining, not the <i>perpendicular</i> distance of a
  point P from the three sides of the triangle, but the distance in a
  direction <i>parallel</i> to the sides of the triangle (Fig. 81).
  Conversely, in order to represent a mixture consisting of <i>a</i>,
  <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i> parts of the components A, B, and C respectively,
  one side of the triangle, say AB, is first of all divided into ten or one
  <!-- Page 238 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page238"></a>{238}</span>hundred parts; a portion, B<i>x</i> =
  <i>a</i>, is then measured off, and represents the amount of A present.
  Similarly, a portion, A<i>x&prime;</i> = <i>b</i>, is measured off and
  represents the fractional amount of B, while the remainder,
  <i>xx&prime;</i> = <i>c</i>, represents the amount of C. From <i>x</i>
  and <i>x&prime;</i> lines are drawn parallel to the sides of the
  triangle, and the point of intersection, P, represents the composition of
  the ternary mixture of given composition; for, as is evident from the
  figure, the distance of the point P from the three sides of the triangle,
  when measured in directions <i>parallel</i> to the sides, is equal to
  <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i> respectively. From the division marks on
  the side AB, it is seen that the point P in this figure also represents a
  mixture of 0.5 parts of A, 0.2 parts of B, and 0.3 parts of C. This gives
  exactly the same result as the previous method. The employment of a
  right-angled isosceles triangle has also been suggested,<a name="NtA319"
  href="#Nt319"><sup>[319]</sup></a> but is not in general use.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:25%;">

      alt="Fig. 81" title="Fig. 81" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 81.</span>
  </div>

  <p>In employing the triangular diagram, it will be of use to note a
  property of the equilateral triangle. A line drawn from one corner of the
  triangle to the opposite side, represents the composition of all mixtures
  in which the <i>relative</i> amounts of two of the components remain
  unchanged. Thus, as Fig. 82 shows, if the component C is added to a
  mixture x, in which A and B are present in the proportions of <i>a</i> :
  <i>b</i>, a mixture <i>x&prime;</i>, which is thereby obtained, also
  contains A and B in the ratio <i>a</i> : <i>b</i>. For the two triangles
  AC<i>x</i> and BC<i>x</i> are similar to the two triangles
  HC<i>x&prime;</i> and KC<i>x&prime;</i>; and, <!-- Page 239 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page239"></a>{239}</span>therefore, A<i>x</i> :
  B<i>x</i> = H<i>x&prime;</i> : K<i>x&prime;</i>. But A<i>x</i> =
  D<i>x</i> and B<i>x</i> = E<i>x</i>; further H<i>x&prime;</i> =
  F<i>x&prime;</i> and K<i>x&prime;</i> = G<i>x&prime;</i>. Therefore,
  D<i>x</i> : E<i>x</i> = F<i>x&prime;</i> : G<i>x&prime;</i> = <i>b</i> :
  <i>a</i>. At all points on the line C<i>x</i>, therefore, the ratio of A
  to B is the same.</p>

  <p>If it is desired to represent at the same time the change of another
  independent variable, <i>e.g.</i> temperature, this can be done by
  measuring the latter along axes drawn perpendicular to the corners of the
  triangle. In this way a right prism (Fig. 83) is obtained, and each
  section of this cut parallel to the base represents therefore an
  <i>isothermal surface</i>.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV</h3>

<p class="cenhead">SOLUTIONS OF LIQUIDS IN LIQUIDS</p>

  <p>We have already seen (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page95">95</a>) that when two
  liquids are brought together, they may mix in all proportions and form
  one homogeneous liquid phase; or, only partial miscibility may occur, and
  two phases be formed consisting of two mutually saturated solutions. In
  the latter case, the concentration of the components in either phase and
  also the vapour pressure of the system had, at a given temperature,
  perfectly definite values. In the case of three liquid components, a
  similar behaviour may be found, although complete miscibility of three
  components with the formation of only one liquid phase is of much rarer
  occurrence than in the case of two components. When only partial
  miscibility occurs, various cases are met with according as the three
  components form one, two, or three pairs of partially miscible liquids.
  Further, when two of the components are only partially miscible, the
  addition of the third may cause either an increase or a diminution in the
  mutual solubility of these. An increase in the mutual solubility is
  generally found when the third component dissolves readily in each of the
  other two; but when the third component dissolves only sparingly in the
  other two, its addition diminishes the mutual solubility of the
  latter.</p>

  <p>We shall consider here only a few examples illustrating the three
  chief cases which can occur, viz. (1) A and B, and also B and C are
  miscible in all proportions, while A and C are only partially miscible.
  (2) A and B are miscible in all proportions, but A and C and B and C are
  only partially miscible. (3) A and B, B and C, and A and C are only
  partially miscible. A, B, and C here represent the three components.</p>

  <p>1.&mdash;<i>The three components form only one pair of partially
  miscible liquids.</i> <!-- Page 241 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page241"></a>{241}</span></p>

  <p>An example of this is found in the three substances: chloroform,
  water, and acetic acid.<a name="NtA320"
  href="#Nt320"><sup>[320]</sup></a> Chloroform and acetic acid, and water
  and acetic acid, are miscible with one another in all proportions, but
  chloroform and water are only partially miscible with one another. If,
  therefore, chloroform is shaken with a larger quantity of water than it
  can dissolve, two layers will be formed consisting one of a saturated
  solution of water in chloroform, the other of a saturated solution of
  chloroform in water. The composition of these two solutions at a
  temperature of about 18°, will be represented by the points <i>a</i> and
  <i>b</i> in Fig. 84; <i>a</i> representing a solution of the composition:
  chloroform, 99 per cent.; water, 1 per cent.; and <i>b</i> a solution of
  the composition: chloroform, 0.8 per cent.; water, 99.2 per cent. When
  acetic acid is added, it distributes itself between the two liquid
  layers, and two conjugate <i>ternary</i> solutions, consisting of
  chloroform, water, and acetic acid are thereby produced which are in
  equilibrium with one another, and the composition of which will be
  represented by two points inside the triangle. In this way a series of
  pairs of ternary solutions will be obtained by the addition of acetic
  acid to the mixture of chloroform and water. By this addition, also, not
  only do the two liquid phases become increasingly rich in acetic acid,
  but the mutual solubility of the chloroform and water increases; so that
  the layer <i>a</i> becomes relatively richer in water, and layer <i>b</i>
  relatively richer in chloroform. This is seen from the following table,
  which gives the percentage composition of different conjugate ternary
  solutions at 18°.</p>

<p><!-- Page 242 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page242"></a>{242}</span></p>

  <p>By the continued addition of acetic acid, the composition of the
  successive conjugate solutions in equilibrium with one another becomes,
  as the table shows, more nearly the same, and a point is at length
  reached at which the two solutions become identical. This will therefore
  be a <i>critical point</i> (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page98">98</a>). Increased
  addition of acetic acid beyond this point will lead to a single
  homogeneous solution.</p>

  <p>These relationships are represented graphically by the curve
  <i>a</i>K<i>b</i>, Fig. 84. The points on the branch <i>a</i>K represent
  the composition of the solutions relatively rich in chloroform (heavier
  layer), those on the curve <i>b</i>K the composition of solutions
  relatively rich in water (lighter layer); and the points on these two
  branches representing conjugate solutions are joined together by
  "tie-lines." Thus, the points <i>a&prime;b&prime;</i> represent conjugate
  solutions, and the line <i>a&prime;b&prime;</i> is a tie-line.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:32%;">
      <a href="images/fig084.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig084.png"
      alt="Fig. 84" title="Fig. 84" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 84.
  </div>

  <p>Since, now, acetic acid when added to a heterogeneous mixture of
  chloroform and water does not enter in equal amounts into the two layers,
  but in amounts depending on its coefficient of distribution between
  chloroform and water,<a name="NtA321" href="#Nt321"><sup>[321]</sup></a>
  the <!-- Page 243 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page243"></a>{243}</span>tie-lines will not be parallel to AB, but
  will be inclined at an angle. As the solutions become more nearly the
  same, the tie-lines diminish in length, and at last, when the conjugate
  solutions become identical, shrink to a point. For the reason that the
  tie-lines are, in general, not parallel to the side of the triangle, the
  critical point at which the tie-line vanishes will not be at the summit
  of the curve, but somewhere below this, as represented by the point
  K.</p>

  <p>The curve <i>a</i>K<i>b</i>, further, forms the boundary between the
  heterogeneous and homogeneous systems. A mixture of chloroform, water,
  and acetic acid represented by any point outside the curve
  <i>a</i>K<i>b</i>, will form only one homogeneous phase; while any
  mixture represented by a point within the curve, will separate into two
  layers having the composition represented by the ends of the tie-line
  passing through that point. Thus, a mixture of the total composition
  <i>x</i>, will separate into two layers having the composition
  <i>a&prime;</i> and <i>b&prime;</i> respectively.</p>

  <p>Since three components existing in three phases (two liquid and a
  vapour phase) constitute a bivariant system, the final result,
  <i>i.e.</i> the composition of the two layers and the total vapour
  pressure, will not depend merely on the temperature, as in the case of
  two-component systems (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page102">102</a>), but also on the
  composition of the mixture with which we start. At constant temperature,
  however, all mixtures, the composition of which is represented by a point
  on one and the same tie-line, will separate into the same two liquid
  phases, although the relative <i>amounts</i> of the two phases will vary.
  If we omit the vapour phase, the condition of the system will depend on
  the pressure as well as on the temperature and composition of the initial
  mixture. By keeping the pressure constant, <i>e.g.</i> at atmospheric
  pressure (by working with open vessels), the system again becomes
  bivariant. We see, therefore, that the position of the curve
  <i>a</i>K<i>b</i>, or, in other words, the composition of the different
  conjugate ternary solutions, will vary with the temperature, and only
  with the temperature, if we assume either constancy of pressure or the
  presence of the vapour phase. Since at the critical point the condition
  is imposed that the two liquid phases become identical, one degree of
  freedom is thereby <!-- Page 244 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page244"></a>{244}</span>lost, and therefore only one degree of
  freedom remains. The critical point, therefore, depends on the
  temperature, and only on the temperature; always on the assumption, of
  course, that the pressure is constant, or that a vapour phase is present.
  Fig. 84, therefore, represents an isothermal (p.&nbsp;<a
  href="#page239">239</a>).</p>

  <p>It is of importance to note that the composition of the different
  ternary solutions obtained by the addition of acetic acid to a
  heterogeneous mixture of chloroform and water, will depend not only on
  the amount of acetic acid added, but also on the relative amounts of
  chloroform and water at the commencement. Suppose, for example, that we
  start with chloroform and water in the proportions represented by the
  point <i>c&prime;</i> (Fig. 84). On mixing these, two liquid layers
  having the composition <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> respectively will be formed.
  Since by the addition of acetic acid the relative amounts of these two
  substances in the system as a whole cannot undergo alteration, the total
  composition of the different ternary systems which will be obtained must
  be represented by a point on the line C<i>c&prime;</i> (p.&nbsp;<a
  href="#page238">238</a>). Thus, for example, by the addition of acetic
  acid a system may be obtained, the total composition of which is
  represented by the point <i>c&Prime;</i>. Such a system, however, will
  separate into two conjugate ternary solutions, the composition of which
  will be represented by the ends of the tie-line passing through the point
  <i>c&Prime;</i>. So long as the total composition of the system lies
  below the point S, <i>i.e.</i> the point of intersection of the line
  C<i>c&prime;</i> with the boundary curve, two liquid layers will be
  formed; while all systems having a total composition represented by a
  point on the line C<i>c&prime;</i>, above S, will form only one
  homogeneous solution.</p>

  <p>From the figure, also, it is evident that as the amount of acetic acid
  is increased, the relative amounts of the two liquid layers formed differ
  more and more until at S a limiting position is reached, when the amount
  of the one liquid layer dwindles to nought, and only one solution
  remains.</p>

  <p>The same reasoning can be carried through for different initial
  amounts of chloroform and water, but it would be fruitless to discuss all
  the different systems which can be obtained. The reason for the preceding
  discussion was to show that <!-- Page 245 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page245"></a>{245}</span>although the addition of acetic acid to a
  mixture of chloroform and water will, in all cases, lead ultimately to a
  limiting system, beyond which homogeneity occurs, that point is not
  necessarily the critical point. On the contrary, in order that addition
  of acetic acid shall lead to the critical mixture, it is necessary to
  start with a binary mixture of chloroform and water in the proportions
  represented by the point <i>c&prime;</i>. In this case, addition of
  acetic acid will give rise to a series of conjugate ternary solutions,
  the composition of which will gradually approach to one another, and at
  last become identical.</p>

  <p>From the foregoing it will be evident that the amount of acetic acid
  required to produce a homogenous solution, will depend on the relative
  amounts of chloroform and water from which we start, and can be
  ascertained by joining the corner C with the point on the line AB
  representing the total composition of the initial binary system. The
  point where this line intersects the boundary curve <i>a</i>K<i>b</i>
  will indicate the minimum amount of acetic acid which, under these
  particular conditions, is necessary to give one homogeneous solution.</p>

  <p><b>Retrograde Solubility.</b>&mdash;As a consequence of the fact that
  acetic acid distributes itself unequally between chloroform and water,
  and the critical point K, therefore, does not lie at the summit of the
  curve, it is possible to start with a homogeneous solution in which the
  percentage amount of acetic acid is greater than at the critical point,
  and to pass from this first to a heterogenous and then again to a
  homogenous system merely by altering the relative amounts of chloroform
  and water. This phenomenon, to which the term <i>retrograde
  solubility</i> is applied, will be observed not only in the case of
  chloroform, water, and acetic acid, but in all other systems in which the
  critical point lies below the highest point of the boundary curve for
  heterogeneous systems. This will be seen from the diagram, Fig. 85.
  Starting with the homogeneous system represented by <i>x</i>, in which,
  therefore, the concentration of C is greater than in the critical mixture
  (K), if the relative amounts of A and B are altered in the direction
  <i>xx&prime;</i>, while the amount of C is maintained constant, the
  system will become heterogeneous when the composition reaches the point
  <i>y</i>, and will remain <!-- Page 246 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page246"></a>{246}</span>heterogeneous with changing composition
  until the point <i>y&prime;</i> is passed, when it will again become
  homogeneous. If the relative concentration of C is increased above that
  represented by the line SS, this phenomenon will, of course, no longer be
  observed.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 85.
  </div>

  <p>Relationships similar to those described for chloroform, water, and
  acetic acid are also found in the case of a number of other trios,
  <i>e.g.</i> ether, water, and alcohol; chloroform, water, and alcohol.<a
  name="NtA322" href="#Nt322"><sup>[322]</sup></a> They have also been
  observed in the case of a considerable number of molten metals.<a
  name="NtA323" href="#Nt323"><sup>[323]</sup></a> Thus, molten lead and
  silver, as well as molten zinc and silver, mix in all proportions; but
  molten lead and zinc are only partially miscible with one another. When
  melted together, therefore, the last two metals will separate into two
  liquid layers, one rich in lead, the other rich in zinc. If silver is now
  added, and the temperature maintained above the freezing point of the
  mixture, the silver passes for the most part, in accordance with the law
  of distribution, into the upper layer, which is rich in zinc; silver
  being more soluble in molten zinc than in molten lead. This is clearly
  shown by the following figures:&mdash;<a name="NtA324"

  <p>The numbers in the same horizontal row give the composition of the
  conjugate alloys, and it is evident that the upper layer consists almost
  entirely of silver and zinc. On allowing the mixture to cool slightly,
  the upper layer solidifies first, and can be separated from the still
  molten lead layer. It is on this behaviour of silver towards a mixture of
  molten lead and zinc that the Parkes's method for the desilverization of
  lead depends.<a name="NtA325" href="#Nt325"><sup>[325]</sup></a> If
  aluminium is also added, a still larger proportion of silver passes into

  <p><b>The Influence of Temperature.</b>&mdash;As has already been said, a
  ternary system existing in three phases possesses two degrees of freedom;
  and the state of the system is therefore dependent not only on the
  relative concentration of the components, but also on the temperature. As
  the temperature changes, therefore, the boundary curve of the
  heterogeneous system will also alter; and in order to represent this
  alteration we shall make use of the right prism, in which the temperature
  is measured upwards. In this way the boundary curve passes into a
  boundary surface (called a dineric surface), as shown in Fig. 86. In this
  figure the curve <i>akb</i> is the isothermal for the ternary system; the
  curve <i>a</i>K<i>b</i> shows the change in the <i>binary</i> system AB
  with the temperature, with <!-- Page 248 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page248"></a>{248}</span>a critical point at K. This curve has the
  same meaning as those given in Chapter VI. The curve <i>k</i>K is a
  critical curve joining together the critical points of the different
  isothermals. In such a case as is shown in Fig. 86, there does not exist
  any real critical temperature for the ternary system, for as the
  temperature is raised, the amount of C in the "critical" solution becomes
  less and less, and at K only two components, A and B, are present. In the
  case, however, represented in Fig. 87, a real ternary critical point is
  found. In this figure <i>ak&prime;b</i> is an isothermal,
  <i>ak&Prime;</i> is the curve for the binary system, and K is the ternary
  critical point. All points outside the helmet-shaped boundary surface
  represent homogeneous ternary solutions, while all points within the
  surface belong to heterogeneous systems. Above the temperature of the
  point K, the three components are miscible in all proportions. An example
  of a ternary system yielding such a boundary surface is that consisting
  of phenol, water, and acetone.<a name="NtA327"
  href="#Nt327"><sup>[327]</sup></a> In this case the critical temperature
  K is 92°, and the composition at this ternary critical point
  is&mdash;</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 88.
  </div>

  <p>The difference between the two classes of systems just mentioned, is
  seen very clearly by a glance at the Figs. 88 and 89, which show the
  projection of the isothermals on the base of the prism. In Fig. 88, the
  projections yield paraboloid curves, the two branches of which are cut by
  one side of the triangle; and the critical point is represented by a
  point on <!-- Page 249 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page249"></a>{249}</span>this side. In the second case (Fig. 89),
  however, the projections of the isothermals form ellipsoidal curves
  surrounding the supreme critical point, which now lies <i>inside the
  triangle</i>. At lower temperatures, these isothermal boundary curves are
  cut by a side of the triangle; at the critical temperature,
  <i>k&Prime;</i>, of the binary system AB, the boundary curve
  <i>touches</i> the side AB, while at still higher temperatures the
  boundary curve comes to lie entirely within the triangle. At any given
  temperature, therefore, between the critical point of the binary system
  (<i>k&Prime;</i>), and the supreme critical point of the ternary system
  (K), each pair of the three components are miscible with one another in
  all proportions; for the region of heterogeneous systems is now bounded
  by a closed curve lying entirely within the triangle. Outside this curve
  only homogeneous systems are found. Binary mixtures, therefore,
  represented by any point on one of the sides of the triangle must be
  homogeneous, for they all lie outside the boundary curve for
  heterogeneous states.</p>

  <p>As we have already seen (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page122">122</a>), water and
  succinic nitrile can form two liquid layers between the temperatures
  18.5° and 55.5°; while alcohol and nitrile can form two liquid layers
  <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'betwen'.">between</span>
  13° and 31°. If, then, between these two temperature limits, alcohol is
  added to a heterogeneous mixture of water and nitrile, or water is added
  to a mixture of alcohol and nitrile, two heterogeneous ternary systems
  will be formed, <!-- Page 250 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page250"></a>{250}</span>and two boundary curves will be obtained
  in the triangular diagram, as shown in Fig. 90.<a name="NtA328"
  href="#Nt328"><sup>[328]</sup></a> On changing the temperature, the
  boundary curves will also undergo alteration, in a manner similar to that
  just discussed. As the temperature falls, the two curves will spread out
  more and more into the centre of the triangle, and might at last meet one
  another; while at still lower temperatures we may imagine the curves
  still further expanding so that the two heterogeneous regions flow into
  one another and form a <i>band</i> on the triangular diagram (Fig. 91).
  This, certainly, has not been realized in the case of the three
  components mentioned, because at a temperature higher than that at which
  the two heterogeneous regions could fuse together, solid separates
  out.</p>

  <p>All mixtures of water, phenol, and aniline, therefore, the composition
  of which is represented by any point within the band <i>abcd</i>, will
  form two ternary solutions; while if the composition is represented by a
  point outside the band, only one homogeneous solution will be
  produced.</p>

  <p>3. <i>The three components form three pairs of partially miscible
  liquids.</i></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:24%;">
      <a href="images/fig093.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig093.png"
      alt="Fig. 93" title="Fig. 93" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 93.
  </div>

  <p>The third chief case which can occur is that no two of the components
  are completely miscible with one another. In this case, therefore, we
  shall obtain three paraboloid boundary curves, as shown in Fig. 93. If,
  now, we imagine these three curves to expand in towards the centre of the
  triangle, as might happen, for example, by lowering the temperature, a
  point will <!-- Page 252 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page252"></a>{252}</span>be reached at which the curves partly
  overlap, and we shall get the appearance shown in Fig. 94.</p>

  <p>The points <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i> represent the points where
  the three curves cut, and the triangle <i>abc</i> is a region where the
  curves overlap. From this diagram we can see that any mixture having a
  composition represented by a point in one of the clear spaces at the
  corners of the larger triangle, will form a homogeneous solution; if the
  composition corresponds to any point lying in one of the quadrilateral
  regions <i>x</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>x</i><sub>2</sub> or
  <i>x</i><sub>3</sub>, two ternary solutions will be formed; while, if the
  composition is represented by any point in the inner triangle, separation
  into three layers will occur.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:26%;">
      <a href="images/fig094.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig094.png"
      alt="Fig. 94" title="Fig. 94" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 94.
  </div>

  <p>Since in the clear regions at the corners of the triangle we have
  three components in two phases, liquid and vapour, the systems have three
  degrees of freedom. At constant temperature, therefore, the condition of
  the system is not defined until the concentrations of two of the
  components are fixed. A system belonging to one of the quadrilateral
  spaces has, as we have seen, two degrees of freedom; besides the
  temperature, one concentration must be fixed. Lastly, a system the
  composition of which falls within the inner triangle <i>abc</i>, will
  form three layers, and will therefore possess only one degree of freedom.
  If the temperature is fixed, the composition of the three layers is also
  determined, viz. that of the points <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i>
  respectively; and a change in the composition of the original mixture can
  lead only to a difference in the relative amounts of the three layers,
  not to a difference in their composition.</p>

  <p>An example of a system which can form three liquid phases is found in
  water, ether, and succinic nitrile.<a name="NtA330"

<h3>CHAPTER XV</h3>

<p class="cenhead">PRESENCE OF SOLID PHASES</p>

  <p><b>A. The Ternary Eutectic Point.</b>&mdash;In passing to the
  consideration of those ternary systems in which one or more solid phases
  can exist together with one liquid phase, we shall first discuss not the
  solubility curves, as in the case of two-component systems, but the
  simpler relationships met with at the freezing point. That is, we shall
  first of all examine the freezing point curves of ternary systems.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:19%;">
      <a href="images/fig095.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig095.png"
      alt="Fig. 95" title="Fig. 95" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 95.
  </div>

  <p>Since it is necessary to take into account not only the changing
  composition of the liquid phase, but also the variation of the
  temperature, we shall employ the right prism for the graphic
  representation of the systems, as shown in Fig. 95. A, B, and C in this
  figure, therefore, denote the melting points of the pure components. If
  we start with the component A at its melting point, and add B, which is
  capable of dissolving in liquid A, the freezing point of A will be
  lowered; and, similarly, the freezing point of B by addition of A. In
  this way we get the freezing point curve A<i>k</i><sub>1</sub>B for the
  binary system; <i>k</i><sub>1</sub>; being an eutectic point. This curve
  will of course lie in the plane formed by one face of the prism. In a
  similar manner we obtain the freezing point curves A<i>k</i><sub>2</sub>C
  and B<i>k</i><sub>3</sub>C. These curves give the composition of the
  binary liquid phases in equilibrium <!-- Page 254 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page254"></a>{254}</span>with one of the pure
  components, or at the eutectic points, with a mixture of two solid
  components. If, now, to the system represented say by the point
  <i>k</i><sub>1</sub>, a small quantity of the third component, C, is
  added, the temperature at which the two solid phases A and B can exist in
  equilibrium with the liquid phase is lowered; and this depression of the
  eutectic point is all the greater the larger the addition of C. In this
  way we obtain the curve <i>k</i><sub>1</sub>K, which slopes inwards and
  downwards, and indicates the varying composition of the ternary liquid
  phase with which a mixture of solid A and B are in equilibrium.
  Similarly, the curves <i>k</i><sub>2</sub>K and <i>k</i><sub>3</sub>K are
  the corresponding eutectic curves for A and C, and B and C in equilibrium
  with ternary solutions. At the point K, the three solid components are in
  equilibrium with the liquid phase; and this point, therefore, represents
  <i>the lowest temperature attainable with the three components given</i>.
  Each of the ternary eutectic curves, as they may be called, is produced
  by the intersection of two surfaces, while at the ternary eutectic point,
  three surfaces, viz. A<i>k</i><sub>1</sub>K<i>k</i><sub>2</sub>,
  B<i>k</i><sub>1</sub>K<i>k</i><sub>3</sub>, and
  C<i>k</i><sub>1</sub>K<i>k</i><sub>3</sub> intersect. Any point on one of
  these surfaces represents a ternary solution in equilibrium with only one
  component in the solid state; the lines or curves of intersection of
  these represent equilibria with two solid phases, while at the point K,
  the ternary eutectic point, there are three solid phases in equilibrium
  with a liquid and a vapour phase. The surfaces just mentioned represent
  bivariant systems. One component in the solid state can exist in
  equilibrium with a ternary liquid phase under varying conditions of
  temperature and concentration of the components in the solution; and
  before the state of the system is defined, these two variables,
  temperature and composition of the liquid phase, must be fixed. On the
  other hand, the curves formed by the intersection of these planes
  represent univariant systems; at a given temperature two solid phases can
  exist in equilibrium with a ternary solution, only when the latter has a
  definite composition. Lastly, the ternary eutectic point, K, represents
  an invariant system; three solid phases can exist in equilibrium with a
  ternary solution, only when the latter has one fixed composition and when
  the temperature has a definite value. This eutectic point, therefore,
  <!-- Page 255 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page255"></a>{255}</span>has a perfectly definite position,
  depending only on the nature of the three components.</p>

  <p>Instead of employing the prism, the change in the composition of the
  ternary solutions can also be indicated by means of the
  <i>projections</i> of the curves <i>k</i><sub>1</sub>K,
  <i>k</i><sub>2</sub>K, and <i>k</i><sub>3</sub>K on the base of the
  prism, the particular temperature being written beside the different
  eutectic points and curves. This is shown in Fig. 96.</p>

  <p><b>Formation of Compounds.</b>&mdash;In the case just discussed, the
  components crystallized out from solution in the pure state. If, however,
  combination can take place between two of the components, the
  relationships will be somewhat different; the curves which are obtained
  in such a case being represented in Fig. 97. From the figure, we see that
  the two components B <!-- Page 256 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page256"></a>{256}</span>and C form a compound, and the freezing
  point curve of the binary system has therefore the form shown in Fig. 64
  (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page209">209</a>). Further, there are two <i>ternary</i>
  eutectic points, K<sub>1</sub> and K<sub>2</sub>, the solid phases
  present being A, B, and compound, and A, C, and compound
  respectively.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:17%;">

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 97.
  </div>

  <p>The particular point, now, to which it is desired to draw attention is
  this. Suppose the ternary eutectic curves projected on a plane parallel
  to the face of the prism containing B and C, <i>i.e.</i> suppose the
  concentrations of the two components B and C, between which interaction
  can occur, expressed in terms of a constant amount of the third component
  A,<a name="NtA332" href="#Nt332"><sup>[332]</sup></a> curves will then be
  obtained which are in every respect analogous to the freezing point
  curves of binary systems. Thus, suppose the eutectic curves
  <i>k</i><sub>1</sub>K and <i>k</i><sub>2</sub>K in Fig. 95 projected on
  the face BC of the prism, then evidently a curve will be obtained
  consisting of two branches meeting in an eutectic point. On the other
  hand, the projection of the ternary eutectic curves in Fig. 97 on the
  face BC of the prism, will give a curve consisting of three portions, as
  shown by the outline
  <i>k</i><sub>1</sub>K<sub>1</sub>K<sub>2</sub><i>k</i><sub>2</sub> in
  Fig. 97.</p>

  <p>Various examples of this have been studied, and the following table

  <p>From what has been said, it will be apparent that if the ternary
  eutectic curve of a three-component system (in which one of the
  components is present in constant amount) is determined, it will be
  possible to state, from the form of curve obtained, whether or not the
  two components present in varying amount crystallize out pure or combine
  with one another to form a compound. It may be left to the reader to work
  out the curves for the other possible systems; but it will be apparent,
  that the projections of the ternary eutectic curves in the manner given
  will yield a series of curves alike in all points to the binary curves
  given in Figs. 63-65, pp.&nbsp;<a href="#page208">208</a>-210.</p>

  <p>Since, from the method of investigation, the temperatures of the
  eutectic curves will depend on the melting point of the third component
  (A), it is possible, by employing substances with widely differing
  melting points, to investigate the interaction of the two components
  (<i>e.g.</i> two optical antipodes) B and C over a range of temperature;
  and thus determine the range of stability of the compound, if one is
  formed. Since, in some cases, two substances which at one temperature
  form mixed crystals combine at another temperature to form a definite
  compound, the relationships which have just been described can be
  employed, and indeed, have been employed, to determine the temperature at
  which this change occurs.<a name="NtA334"
  href="#Nt334"><sup>[334]</sup></a> By means of this method, Adriani found
  that below 103° <i>i</i>-camphoroxime exists as a racemic compound, while

  <p><b>B. Equilibria at Higher Temperatures. Formation of Double
  Salts.</b>&mdash;After having studied the relationships which are found
  in the neighbourhood of the freezing points of the components, we now
  pass to the discussion of the equilibria which are met with at higher
  temperatures. In this connection we shall confine the discussion entirely
  to the systems formed of two salts and water, dealing more particularly
  with those cases in which the water is present in relatively large amount
  and acts as solvent. Further, in studying these systems, one restriction
  must be made, viz. that the single salts are salts either of the same
  base or of the same acid; or are, in other words, capable of yielding a
  common ion in solution. Such a restriction is necessary, because
  otherwise the system would be one not of three but of four components.<a
  name="NtA336" href="#Nt336"><sup>[336]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Transition Point.</b>&mdash;As is very well known, there exist a
  number of hydrated salts which, on being heated, undergo apparent partial
  fusion; and in Chapter V. the behaviour of such hydrates was more fully
  studied in the light of the Phase Rule. Glauber's salt, or sodium
  sulphate decahydrate, for example, on being heated to a temperature of
  about 32.5°, partially liquefies, owing to the fact that the water of
  crystallization is split off and anhydrous sodium sulphate formed, as
  shown by the equation&mdash;</p>

<p class="cenhead">Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,10H<sub>2</sub>O = Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 10H<sub>2</sub>O</p>

  <p>The temperature of 32.5°, it was learned, constituted a <i>transition
  point</i> for the decahydrate and anhydrous salt plus water;
  decomposition of the hydrated salt occurring above this temperature,
  combination of the anhydrous salt and water below it.</p>

  <p>Analogous phenomena are met with in systems constituted of two salts
  and water in which the formation of double salts can take place. Thus,
  for example, if <i>d</i>-sodium potassium <!-- Page 259 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page259"></a>{259}</span>tartrate is heated to
  above 55°, apparent partial fusion occurs, and the two single salts,
  <i>d</i>-sodium tartrate and <i>d</i>-potassium tartrate, are deposited,
  the change which occurs being represented by the equation&mdash;</p>

<p class="cenhead">4NaKC<sub>4</sub>O<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>,4H<sub>2</sub>O = 2Na<sub>2</sub>C<sub>4</sub>O<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O + 2K<sub>2</sub>C<sub>4</sub>O<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>,½H<sub>2</sub>O + 11H<sub>2</sub>O</p>

  <p>On the other hand, if sodium and potassium tartrates are mixed with
  water in the proportions shown on the right side of the equation, the
  system will remain partially liquid so long as the temperature is
  maintained above 55° (in a closed vessel to prevent loss of water), but
  on allowing the temperature to fall below this point, complete
  solidification will ensue, owing to the formation of the hydrated double
  salt. Below 55°, therefore, the hydrated double salt is the stable
  system, while above this temperature the two single salts plus saturated
  solution are stable.<a name="NtA337"
  href="#Nt337"><sup>[337]</sup></a></p>

  <p>A similar behaviour is found in the case of the double salt copper
  dipotassium chloride (CuCl<sub>2</sub>,2KCl,2H<sub>2</sub>O or
  CuK<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O).<a name="NtA338"
  href="#Nt338"><sup>[338]</sup></a> When this salt is heated to 92°,
  partial liquefaction occurs, and the original blue plate-shaped crystals
  give place to brown crystalline needles and white cubes; while on
  allowing the temperature to fall, re-formation of the blue double salt
  ensues. The temperature 92° is, therefore, a transition point at which
  the reversible reaction&mdash;</p>

<p class="cenhead">CuK<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O <a href="images/doublearrow.png"><img src="images/doublearrow.png" class="middle" style="height:2.5ex" alt="reversible arrow" /></a> CuKCl<sub>3</sub> + KCl + 2H<sub>2</sub>O</p>

  <p>takes place.</p>

  <p>The decomposition of sodium potassium tartrate, or of copper
  dipotassium chloride, differs in so far from that of Glauber's salt that
  <i>two</i> new solid phases are formed; and in the case of copper
  dipotassium chloride, one of the decomposition products is itself a
  double salt.</p>

  <p>In the two examples of double salt decomposition which have just been
  mentioned, sufficient water was yielded to cause a partial liquefaction;
  but other cases are known where this is not so. Thus, when copper calcium
  acetate is heated to a <!-- Page 260 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page260"></a>{260}</span>temperature of 75°, although decomposition
  of the double salt into the two single salts occurs as represented by the
  equation<a name="NtA339" href="#Nt339"><sup>[339]</sup></a>&mdash;</p>

<p class="cenhead">CuCa(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>,8H<sub>2</sub>O = Cu(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O + Ca(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O
   + 6H<sub>2</sub>O</p>

  <p>the amount of water split off is insufficient to give the appearance
  of partial fusion, and, therefore, only a change in the crystals is
  observed.</p>

  <p>The preceding examples, in which decomposition of the double salt was
  effected by a rise of temperature, were chosen for first consideration as
  being more analogous to the case of Glauber's salt; but not a few
  examples are known where the reverse change takes place, formation of the
  double salt occurring <i>above</i> the transition point, and
  decomposition into the constituent salts below it. Instances of this
  behaviour are found in the case of the formation of astracanite from
  sodium and magnesium sulphates, and of sodium ammonium racemate from the
  two sodium ammonium tartrates, to which reference will be made later.
  Between these various systems, however, there is no essential difference;
  and whether decomposition or formation of the double salt occurs at
  temperatures above the transition point, will of course depend on the
  heat of change at that point. For, in accordance with van't Hoff's law of
  movable equilibrium (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page58">58</a>), that change will take
  place at the higher temperature which is accompanied by an absorption of
  heat. If, therefore, the formation of the double salt from the single
  salts is accompanied by an absorption of heat, the double salt will be
  formed from the single salts on raising the temperature; but if the
  reverse is the case, then the double salt on being heated will decompose
  into the constituent salts.<a name="NtA340"
  href="#Nt340"><sup>[340]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In those cases, now, which have so far been studied, the change at the
  transition point is accompanied by a taking up or a splitting off of
  water; and <i>in such cases the general rule can be given, that if the
  water of crystallization of the two constituent <!-- Page 261 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page261"></a>{261}</span>salts together is
  greater than that of the double salt, the latter will be produced from
  the former on raising the temperature</i> (<i>e.g.</i> astracanite from
  sodium and magnesium sulphates); <i>but if the double salt contains more
  water of crystallization than the two single salts, increase of
  temperature will effect the decomposition of the double salt</i>. When we
  seek for the connection between this rule and the law of van't Hoff, it
  is found in the fact that the heat effect involved in the hydration or
  dehydration of the salts is much greater than that of the other changes
  which occur, and determines, therefore, the sign of the total heat
  effect.<a name="NtA341" href="#Nt341"><sup>[341]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Vapour Pressure. Quintuple Point.</b>&mdash;In the case of
  Glauber's salt, we saw that at a certain temperature the vapour pressure
  curve of the hydrated salt cut that of the saturated solution of
  anhydrous sodium sulphate. That point, it will be remembered, was a
  quadruple point at which the four phases sodium sulphate decahydrate,
  anhydrous sodium sulphate, solution, and vapour, could co-exist; and was
  also the point of intersection of the curves for four univariant systems.
  In the case of the formation of double salts, similar relationships are
  met with; and also certain differences, due to the fact that we are now
  dealing with systems of three components. Two cases will be chosen here
  for brief description, one in which formation, the other in which
  decomposition of the double salt occurs with rise of temperature.</p>

  <p>On heating a mixture of sodium sulphate decahydrate and magnesium
  sulphate heptahydrate, it is found that at 22° partial liquefaction
  occurs with formation of astracanite. At this temperature, therefore,
  there can coexist the five phases&mdash;</p>

<p class="cenhead">Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,10H<sub>2</sub>O; MgSO<sub>4</sub>,7H<sub>2</sub>O; Na<sub>2</sub>Mg(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,4H<sub>2</sub>O;
solution; vapour.</p>

  <p>This constitutes, therefore, a <i>quintuple point</i>; and since there
  are three components present in five phases, the system is invariant.
  This point, also, will be the point of intersection of curves for five
  univariant systems, which, in this case, must each be composed of four
  phases. These systems are&mdash;</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 98.
  </div>

  <p>On representing the vapour pressures of these different systems
  graphically, a diagram is obtained such as is shown in Fig. 98,<a
  name="NtA342" href="#Nt342"><sup>[342]</sup></a> the curves being
  numbered in accordance with the above list. When the system I. is heated,
  the vapour pressure increases until at the quintuple point the liquid
  phase (solution) is formed, and it will then depend on the relative
  amounts of the different phases whether on further heating there is
  formed system III., IV., or V. If either of the first two is produced, we
  shall obtain the vapour pressure of the solutions saturated with respect
  to both double salt and one of the single salts; while if the vapour
  phase disappears, there will be obtained the pressure of the condensed
  systems formed of double salt, two single salts and solution. This curve,
  therefore, indicates the <i>change of the transition point with
  pressure</i>; and since in the ordinary determinations of the transition
  point in open vessels, we are in reality dealing with condensed systems
  under the pressure of 1 atm., it will be evident that the transition
  point does not accurately coincide with the quintuple point (at which the
  system is under the pressure of its own vapour). As in the case of other
  condensed systems, however, pressure has only a slight influence on the
  temperature of the transition point. Whether or not pressure raises or
  lowers the transition point will depend on whether transformation is
  accompanied by an increase or <!-- Page 263 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page263"></a>{263}</span>diminution of volume (theorem of Le
  Chatelier, p.&nbsp;<a href="#page58">58</a>). In the case of the formation of
  astracanite, expansion occurs, and the transition point will therefore be
  raised by increase of pressure. Although measurements have not been made
  in the case of this system, the existence of such a curve has been
  experimentally verified in the case of copper and calcium acetates and
  water (v. <i>infra</i>).<a name="NtA343"
  href="#Nt343"><sup>[343]</sup></a></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:19%;">
      <a href="images/fig099.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig099.png"
      alt="Fig. 99" title="Fig. 99" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 99.
  </div>

  <p>The vapour pressure diagram in the case of copper calcium acetate and
  water (Fig. 99), is almost the reverse of that already discussed. In this
  case, the double salt decomposes on heating, and the decomposition is
  accompanied by a contraction. Curve I. is the vapour pressure curve for
  double salt, two single salts (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page260">260</a>), and
  vapour; curves II. and III. give the vapour pressures of solutions
  saturated with respect to double salt and one of the single salts; curve
  IV. is the curve of pressures for the solutions saturated with respect to
  the two single salts; while curve V. again represents the change of the
  transition point with pressure. On examining this diagram, it is seen
  that whereas <!-- Page 264 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page264"></a>{264}</span>astracanite could exist both above and
  below the quintuple point, copper calcium acetate can exist only
  <i>below</i> the quintuple point. This behaviour is found only in those
  cases in which the double salt is decomposed by rise of temperature, and
  where the decomposition is accompanied by a diminution of volume.<a
  name="NtA344" href="#Nt344"><sup>[344]</sup></a></p>

  <p>As already mentioned, the decomposition of copper calcium acetate into
  the single salts and saturated solution is accompanied by a contraction,
  and it was therefore to be expected that increase of pressure would
  <i>lower</i> the transition point. This expectation of theory was
  confirmed by experiment, for van't Hoff and Spring found that although
  the transition point under atmospheric pressure is about 75°,
  decomposition of the double salt took place even at the ordinary
  temperature when the pressure was increased to 6000 atm.<a name="NtA345"
  href="#Nt345"><sup>[345]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Solubility Curves at the Transition Point.</b>&mdash;At the
  transition point, as has already been shown, the double salt and the two
  constituent salts can exist in equilibrium with the same solution. The
  transition point, therefore, must be the point of intersection of two
  solubility curves; the solubility curve of the double salt and the
  solubility curve of the mixtures of the two constituent salts. It should
  be noted here that we are not dealing with the solubility curves of the
  single salts separately, for since the systems are composed of three
  components, a single solid phase can, at a given temperature, be in
  equilibrium with solutions of different composition, and two solid phases
  in contact with solution (and vapour) are therefore necessary to give an
  univariant system. The same applies, of course, to the solubility of the
  double salt; for a double salt also constitutes a single phase, and can
  therefore exist in equilibrium with solutions of varying composition. If,
  however, we make the restriction (which we do for the present) that the
  double salt is not decomposed by water, then the solution will contain
  the constituent salts in the same relative proportions as they are
  contained in the double salt, and the system may therefore be regarded as
  one of <i>two</i> components, viz. double salt and water. In this case
  one solid phase is sufficient, with solution and <!-- Page 265 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page265"></a>{265}</span>vapour, to give an
  univariant system; and at a given temperature, therefore, the solubility
  will have a perfectly definite value.</p>

  <p>Since in almost all cases the solubility is determined in open
  vessels, we shall in the following discussion consider that the vapour
  phase is absent, and that the system is under a constant pressure, that
  of the atmosphere. With this restriction, therefore, four phases will
  constitute an invariant system, three phases an univariant, and two
  phases a bivariant system.</p>

  <p>It has already been learned that in the case of sodium sulphate and
  water, the solubility curve of the salt undergoes a sudden change in
  direction at the transition point, and that this is accompanied by a
  change in the solid phase in equilibrium with the solution. The same
  behaviour is also found in the case of double salts. To illustrate this,
  we shall briefly discuss the solubility relations of a few double salts,
  beginning with one of the simplest cases, that of the formation of
  rubidium racemate from rubidium <i>d</i>- and <i>l</i>-tartrates. The
  solubilities are represented diagrammatically in Fig. 100, the numerical
  data being contained in the following table, in which the solubility is

  <p>In Fig. 100 the curve AB represents the solubility of the racemate,
  while A&prime;BC represents the solubility of the mixed tartrates. Below
  the transition point, therefore, the solubility of the racemate is less
  than that of the mixed tartrates. The solution, saturated with respect to
  the latter, will be supersaturated with respect to the racemate; and if a
  nucleus of this is present, racemate will be deposited, and the mixed
  tartrates, if present in equimolecular amounts, will ultimately <!-- Page
  266 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page266"></a>{266}</span>entirely
  disappear, and only racemate will be left as solid phase. The solution
  will then have the composition represented by a point on the curve AB.
  Conversely, above the transition point, the saturated solution of the
  racemate would be supersaturated with respect to the two tartrates, and
  transformation into the latter would ensue. If, therefore, a solution of
  equimolecular proportions of rubidium <i>d</i>- and <i>l</i>-tartrates is
  allowed to evaporate at a temperature above 40°, a mixture of the two
  tartrates will be deposited; while at temperatures below 40° the racemate
  will separate out.</p>

  <p>Similar relationships are met with in the case of sodium ammonium
  <i>d</i>- and <i>l</i>-tartrate and sodium ammonium racemate; but in this
  case the racemate is the stable form in contact with solution above the
  transition point (27°).<a name="NtA347"
  href="#Nt347"><sup>[347]</sup></a> Below the transition point, therefore,
  the solubility curve of the mixed tartrates will lie below the solubility
  curve of the racemate. Below the transition point, therefore, sodium
  ammonium racemate will break up in contact with solution into a mixture
  of sodium ammonium <i>d</i>- and <i>l</i>-tartrates. At a higher
  temperature, 35°, sodium ammonium racemate undergoes decomposition into
  sodium racemate and ammonium racemate.<a name="NtA348"
  href="#Nt348"><sup>[348]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The behaviour of sodium ammonium racemate is of interest from the fact
  that it was the first racemic substance to be resolved into its optically
  active forms by a process of crystallization. On neutralizing a solution
  of racemic tartaric acid, half with soda and half with ammonia, and
  allowing the solution to evaporate, Pasteur<a name="NtA349"
  href="#Nt349"><sup>[349]</sup></a> obtained a mixture of sodium ammonium
  <!-- Page 267 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page267"></a>{267}</span><i>d</i>- and <i>l</i>-tartrates. Since
  Pasteur was unaware of the existence of a transition point, the success
  of his experiment was due to the happy chance that he allowed the
  solution to evaporate at a temperature below 27°; for had he employed a
  temperature above this, separation of the racemate into the two
  enantiomorphous forms would not have occurred. For this reason the
  attempt of Staedel to perform the same resolution met only with
  failure.<a name="NtA350" href="#Nt350"><sup>[350]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Decomposition of the Double Salt by Water.</b>&mdash;In the two
  cases just described, the solubility relationships at the transition
  point are of a simpler character than in the case of most double salts.
  If, at a temperature above the transition point, a mixture of rubidium
  <i>d</i>- and <i>l</i>-tartrates in equimolecular proportions is brought
  in contact with water a solution will be obtained, which is saturated
  with respect to both enantiomorphous forms; and since the solubility of
  the two optical antipodes is identical, and the effect of one on the
  solubility of the other also the same, the solution will contain
  equimolecular amounts of the <i>d</i>- and <i>l</i>-salt. If, now, the
  solution is cooled down in contact with the solid salts to just below the
  transition point, it becomes supersaturated with respect to the racemate,
  and this will be deposited. The solution thereby becomes unsaturated with
  respect to the mixture of the active salts, and these must therefore pass
  into solution. As the latter are equally soluble, equal amounts of each
  will dissolve, and a further quantity of the racemate will be deposited.
  These processes of solution and deposition will continue until the single
  tartrates have completely disappeared, and only racemate is left as solid
  phase. As a consequence of the identical solubility of the two tartrates,
  therefore, no excess of either form will be left on passing through the
  transition point. From this it will be evident that the racemate can
  exist as single solid phase in contact with its saturated solution at the
  transition point; or, in other words, the racemate is not decomposed by
  water at the transition point. The same behaviour will evidently be
  exhibited by sodium ammonium racemate at 27°, for the two enantiomorphous
  sodium ammonium tartrates have also identical solubility.</p>

<p><!-- Page 268 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page268"></a>{268}</span></p>

  <p>Very different, however, is the behaviour of, say, astracanite, or of
  the majority of double salts; for the solubility of the constituent salts
  is now no longer the same. If, for example, excess of a mixture of sodium
  sulphate and magnesium sulphate, in equimolecular proportions, is brought
  in contact with water below the transition point (22°), more magnesium
  sulphate than sodium sulphate will dissolve, the solubility of these two
  salts in a common solution being given by the following figures, which
  express number of molecules of the salt in 100 molecules of water.<a

  <p>At the transition point, then, it is evident that the solution
  contains more magnesium sulphate than sodium sulphate: and this must
  still be the case when astracanite, which contains sodium sulphate and
  magnesium sulphate in equimolecular proportions, separates out. If,
  therefore, the temperature is raised slightly above the transition point,
  magnesium sulphate and sodium sulphate will pass into solution, the
  former, however, in larger quantities than the latter, and astracanite
  will be deposited; and this will go on until all the magnesium sulphate
  has disappeared, and a mixture of astracanite and sodium sulphate
  decahydrate is left as solid phases. Since there are now three phases
  present, the system is univariant (by reason of the restriction
  previously made that the vapour phase is absent), and at a given
  temperature the solution will have a definite composition; as given in
  the following table:&mdash;</p>

  <p>From the above figures, therefore, it will be seen that at a
  temperature just above the transition point a solution in contact with
  the two solid phases, astracanite and Glauber's salt, contains a
  relatively smaller amount of sodium sulphate than a pure solution of
  astracanite would; for in this case there would be equal molecular
  amounts of Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and MgSO<sub>4</sub>. A solution
  which is saturated with respect to astracanite alone, will contain more
  sodium sulphate than the solution saturated with respect to astracanite
  plus Glauber's salt, and the latter will therefore be deposited. From
  this, therefore, it is clear that if astracanite is brought in contact
  with water at about the transition point, it will undergo decomposition
  with separation of Glauber's salt (supersaturation being excluded).</p>

  <p>At the transition point the ratio of sodium sulphate to magnesium
  sulphate is approximately 1 : 1.6. In the case of solutions saturated
  with respect to both astracanite and Glauber's salt, the relative amount
  of sodium sulphate increases as the temperature rises, while in the
  solutions saturated for astracanite and magnesium sulphate, the ratio of
  sodium sulphate to magnesium sulphate decreases.</p>

  <p>If, now, we consider only the temperatures above the transition point,
  we see from the figure that solutions represented by points above the
  line BX contain relatively more sodium sulphate than solutions in contact
  with astracanite and Glauber's salt; and solutions lying below the line
  BC contain relatively more magnesium sulphate than solutions saturated
  with this salt and astracanite. These solutions will therefore not be
  stable, but will deposit in the one case, astracanite and Glauber's salt,
  and in the other case, astracanite and magnesium sulphate, until a point
  on BX or BC is reached. All solutions, however, lying to the right of
  CBX, will be <i>unsaturated</i> with respect to these two pairs of salts,
  and only the solutions represented by the line XY (and which contain
  equimolecular amounts of sodium and magnesium sulphates) will be
  saturated with respect to the pure double salt.</p>

  <p><b>Transition Interval.</b>&mdash;Fig. 101 will also render
  intelligible a point of great importance in connection with astracanite,
  and of double salts generally. At temperatures between those represented
  by the points B and X, the double salt when brought in contact with water
  will be decomposed with separation of sodium sulphate. Above the
  temperature of the point <!-- Page 271 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page271"></a>{271}</span>X, however, the solution of the pure
  double salt is stable, because it can still take up a little of either of
  the components. At temperatures, then, above that at which the solution
  in contact with the double salt and the less soluble single salt,
  contains the single salts in the ratio in which they are present in the
  double salt, solution of the latter will take place without
  decomposition. <i>The range of temperature between that at which double
  salt can begin to be formed (the transition point) and that at which it
  ceases to be decomposed by water is called the transition interval.</i><a
  name="NtA353" href="#Nt353"><sup>[353]</sup></a> If the two single salts
  have identical solubility at the transition point, the transition
  interval diminishes to nought.</p>

  <p>In those cases where the double salt is the stable form below the
  transition point, the transition interval will extend downwards to a
  lower temperature. Fig. 101 will then have the reverse form.</p>

  <p><b>Summary.</b>&mdash;With regard to double salts we have learned that
  their formation from and their decomposition into the single salts, is
  connected with a definite temperature, the <i>transition temperature</i>.
  At this transition temperature two vapour pressure curves cut, viz. a
  curve of dehydration of a mixture of the single salts and the solubility
  curve of the double salt; or the dehydration curve of the double salt and
  the solubility curve of the mixed single salts. The solubility curves,
  also, of these two systems intersect at the transition point, but
  although the formation of the double salt commences at the transition
  point, complete stability in contact with water may not be attained till
  some temperature above (or below) that point. <i>Only when the
  temperature is beyond the transition interval, will a double salt
  dissolve in water without decomposition (</i>e.g.<i> the alums).</i></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI</h3>

<p class="cenhead">ISOTHERMAL CURVES AND THE SPACE MODEL</p>

  <p>In the preceding chapter we considered the changes in the solubility
  of double salts and of mixtures of their constituent salts with the
  temperature; noting, more especially, the relationships between the two
  systems at the transition point. It is now proposed to conclude the study
  of the three-component systems by discussing very briefly the solubility
  relations at constant temperature, or the isothermal solubility curves.
  In this way fresh light will be thrown on the change in the solubility of
  one component by the addition of another component, and also on the
  conditions of formation and stable existence of double salts in solution.
  With the help of these isothermal curves, also, the phenomena of
  crystallization at constant temperature&mdash;phenomena which have not
  only a scientific interest but also an important bearing on the
  industrial preparation of double salts&mdash;will be more clearly
  understood.<a name="NtA354" href="#Nt354"><sup>[354]</sup></a></p>

  <p>A brief description will also be given of the method of representing
  the variation of the concentration of the two salts in the solution with
  the temperature.</p>

  <p><b>Non-formation of Double Salts.</b>&mdash;In Fig. 102 are shown the
  solubility curves of two salts, A and B, which at the given temperature
  do not form a double salt.<a name="NtA355"
  href="#Nt355"><sup>[355]</sup></a> The ordinates represent the amount of
  A, the abscissæ the amount of B in a <i>constant amount</i> of the third
  component, the solvent. The <!-- Page 273 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page273"></a>{273}</span>point A, therefore, represents the
  solubility of the salt A at the given temperature; and similarly, point B
  represents the solubility of B. Since we are dealing with a
  three-component system, one solid phase in contact with solution will
  constitute a bivariant system (in the absence of the vapour phase and
  under a constant pressure). At any given temperature, therefore, the
  concentration of the solution in equilibrium with the solid can undergo
  change. If, now, to a pure solution of A a small quantity of B is added,
  the solubility of A will in general be altered; as a rule it is
  diminished, but sometimes it is increased.<a name="NtA356"
  href="#Nt356"><sup>[356]</sup></a> The curve AC represents the varying
  composition of the solution in equilibrium with the solid component A.
  Similarly, the curve BC represents the composition of the solutions in
  contact with pure B as solid phase. At the point, C, where these two
  curves intersect, there are two solid phases, viz. pure A and pure B, in
  equilibrium with solution, and the system becomes invariant. At this
  point the solution is saturated with respect to both A and B, and at a
  given temperature must have a perfectly definite composition. To take an
  example, if we suppose A to represent sodium sulphate decahydrate, and B,
  magnesium sulphate heptahydrate, and the temperature to be 18.5°
  (<i>i.e.</i> below the transition point), the point C would represent a
  solution containing 2.16 gm.-molecules Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and
  4.57 gm.-molecules MgSO<sub>4</sub> per 100 gm.-molecules of water (p.&nbsp;<a
  href="#page268">268</a>). The curve ACB is the boundary curve for
  saturated solutions; solutions lying outside this curve are
  supersaturated, those lying within the area ACBO, are unsaturated.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 103.
  </div>

  <p><b>Formation of Double Salt.</b>&mdash;We have already learned in the
  preceding chapter that if the temperature is outside<a name="NtA357"
  href="#Nt357"><sup>[357]</sup></a> the <!-- Page 274 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page274"></a>{274}</span>transition interval, it
  is possible to prepare a pure saturated solution of the double salt. If,
  now, we suppose the double salt to contain the two constituent salts in
  equimolecular proportions, its saturated solution must be represented by
  a point lying on the line which bisects the angle AOB; <i>e.g.</i> point
  D, Fig. 103. But a double salt constitutes only a single phase, and can
  exist, therefore, in contact with solutions of varying concentration, as
  represented by EDF.</p>

  <p>Let us compare, now, the relations between the solubility curve for
  the double salt, and those for the two constituent salts. We shall
  suppose that the double salt is formed from the single salts when the
  temperature is raised above a certain point (as in the formation of
  astracanite). At a temperature below the transition point, as we have
  already seen, the solubility of the double salt is greater than that of a
  mixture of the single salts. The curve EDF, therefore, must lie above the
  point C, in the region representing solutions supersaturated with respect
  to the single salts (Fig. 104). Such a solution, however, would be
  metastable, and on being brought in contact with the single salts would
  deposit these and yield a solution represented by the point C. At this
  particular temperature, therefore, the isothermal solubility curve will
  consist of only two branches.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:18%;">
      <a href="images/fig105.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig105.png"
      alt="Fig. 105" title="Fig. 105" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 105.</span>
  </div>

  <p>Suppose, now, that the temperature is that of the transition point. At
  this point, the double salt can exist together with the single salts in
  contact with solution. The solubility curve <!-- Page 275 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page275"></a>{275}</span>of the double salt
  must, therefore, pass through the point C, as shown in Fig. 105.</p>

  <p>From this figure, now, it is seen that a solution saturated with
  respect to double salt alone (point D), is supersaturated with respect to
  the component A. If, then, at the temperature of the transition point,
  excess of the double salt is brought in contact with water,<a
  name="NtA358" href="#Nt358"><sup>[358]</sup></a> and if supersaturation
  is excluded, <i>the double salt will undergo decomposition and the
  component A will be deposited</i>. The relative concentration of the
  component B in the solution will, therefore, increase, and the
  composition of the solution will be thereby altered in the direction DC.
  When the solution has the composition of C, the single salt ceases to be
  deposited, for at this point the solution is saturated for both double
  and single salt; and the system becomes invariant.</p>

  <p>This diagram explains very clearly the phenomenon of the decomposition
  of a double salt at the transition point. As is evident, this
  decomposition will occur when the solution which is saturated at the
  temperature of the transition point, with respect to the two single salts
  (point C), does not contain these salts in the same ratio in which they
  are present in the double salt. If point C lay on the dotted line
  bisecting the right angle, then the pure saturated solution of the double
  salt would not be supersaturated with respect to either of the single
  salts, and the double salt would, therefore, not be decomposed by water.
  As has already been mentioned, this behaviour is found in the case of
  optically active isomerides, the solubilities of which are identical.</p>

  <p>At the transition point, therefore, the isothermal curve also consists
  of two branches; but the point of intersection of the two branches now
  represents a solution which is saturated not <!-- Page 276 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page276"></a>{276}</span>only with respect to
  the single salts, but also for the double salt in presence of the single
  salts.</p>

  <p>We have just seen that by a change of temperature the two solubility
  curves, that for the two single salts and that for the double salt, were
  made to approach one another (<i>cf.</i> Figs. 104 and 105). In the
  previous chapter, however, we found that on passing the transition point
  to the region of stability for the double salt, the solution which is
  saturated for a mixture of the two constituent salts, is supersaturated
  for the double salt. In this case, therefore, point C must lie above the
  solubility curve of the pure double salt (Fig. 106), and a solution of
  the composition C, if brought in contact with double salt, will deposit
  the latter. If the single salts were also present, then as the double
  salt separated out, the single salts would pass into solution, because so
  long as the two single salts are present, the composition of the solution
  must remain unaltered. If one of the single salts disappear before the
  other, there will be left double salt plus A or double salt plus B,
  according to which was in excess; and the composition of the solution
  will be either that represented by D (saturated for double salt plus A),
  or that of the point F (saturated for double salt plus B).</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:18%;">
      <a href="images/fig106.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig106.png"

    <span class="sc">Fig. 106.</span>
  </div>

  <p>In connection with the isothermal represented in Fig. 106, it should
  be noted that at this particular temperature a solution saturated with
  respect to the pure double salt is no longer supersaturated for one of
  the single salts (point D); so that at the temperature of this isothermal
  the double salt is not decomposed by water. At this temperature, further,
  the boundary curve consists of three branches AD, DF, and FB, which give
  the composition of the solutions in equilibrium with pure A, double salt,
  and pure B respectively; while the points D and F represent solutions
  saturated for double salt plus A and double salt plus B.</p>

  <p>On continuing to alter the temperature in the same direction <!-- Page
  277 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page277"></a>{277}</span>as before,
  the relative shifting of the solubility curves becomes more marked, as
  shown in Fig. 107. At the temperature of this isothermal, the solution
  saturated for the double salt now lies in a region of distinct
  unsaturation with respect to the single salts; and the double salt can
  now exist as solid phase in contact with solutions containing both
  relatively more of A (curve ED), and relatively more of B (curve DF),
  than is contained in the double salt itself.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:20%;">

    <span class="sc">Fig. 107.</span>
  </div>

  <p><b>Transition Interval.</b>&mdash;From what has been said, and from an
  examination of the isothermal diagrams, Figs. 104-107, it will be seen
  that by a variation of the temperature we can pass from a condition where
  the double salt is quite incapable of existing in contact with solution
  (supersaturation being excluded), to a condition where the existence of
  the double salt in presence of solution becomes possible; only in the
  presence, however, of one of the single salts (<i>transition point</i>,
  Fig. 105). A further change of temperature leads to a condition where the
  stable existence of the pure double salt in contact with solution just
  becomes possible (Fig. 106); and from this point onwards, pure saturated
  solutions of the double salt can be obtained (Fig. 107). <i>At any
  temperature, therefore, between that represented by Fig. 105, and that
  represented by Fig. 106, the double salt undergoes partial decomposition,
  with deposition of one of the constituent salts.</i> The temperature
  range between the transition point and the temperature at which a stable
  saturated solution of the pure double salt just begins to be possible, is
  known as the <i>transition interval</i> (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page270">270</a>).
  As the figures show, the transition interval is limited on the one side
  by the transition temperature, and on the other by the temperature at
  which the solution saturated for double salt and the less soluble of the
  single salts, contains the component salts in the same ratio as they are
  present in the double salt. The greater the difference in the solubility
  of the single salts, the larger will be the transition interval. <!--
  Page 278 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page278"></a>{278}</span></p>

  <p><b>Isothermal Evaporation.</b>&mdash;The isothermal solubility curves
  are of great importance for obtaining an insight into the behaviour of a
  solution when subjected to isothermal evaporation. To simplify the
  discussion of the relationships found here, we shall still suppose that
  the double salt contains the single salts in equimolecular proportions;
  and we shall, in the first instance, suppose that the unsaturated
  solution with which we commence, also contains the single salts in the
  same ratio. The composition of the solution must, therefore, be
  represented by some point lying on the line OD, the bisectrix of the
  right angle.</p>

  <p>From what has been said, it is evident that when the formation of a
  double salt can occur, three temperature intervals can be distinguished,
  viz. the single-salt interval, the transition interval, and the
  double-salt interval.<a name="NtA359" href="#Nt359"><sup>[359]</sup></a>
  When the temperature lies in the first interval, evaporation leads first
  of all to the crystallization of one of the single salts, and then to the
  separation of both the single salts together. In the second temperature
  interval, evaporation again leads, in the first place, to the deposition
  of one of the single salts, and afterwards to the crystallization of the
  double salt. In the third temperature interval, only the double salt
  crystallizes out. This will become clearer from what follows.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:18%;">
      <a href="images/fig109.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig109.png"
      alt="Fig. 109" title="Fig. 109" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 109.</span>
  </div>

  <div class="figright" style="width:19%;">
      <a href="images/fig108.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig108.png"
      alt="Fig. 108" title="Fig. 108" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 108.</span>
  </div>

  <p>If an unsaturated solution of the two single salts in equimolecular
  proportion (<i>e.g.</i> point <i>x</i>, Fig. 108) is evaporated at a
  temperature at which the formation of double salt is impossible, the
  component A, the solubility curve of which is <!-- Page 279 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page279"></a>{279}</span>cut by the line OD,
  will first separate out; the solution will thereby become richer in B. On
  continued evaporation, more A will be deposited, and the composition of
  the solution will change until it attains the composition represented by
  the point C, when both A and B will be deposited, and the composition of
  the solution will remain unchanged. The result of evaporation will
  therefore be a mixture of the two components.</p>

  <p>If the formation of double salt is possible, but if the temperature
  lies within the transition interval, the relations will be represented by
  a diagram like Fig. 109. Isothermal evaporation of the solution X will
  lead to the deposition of the component A, and the composition of the
  solution will alter in the direction DE; at the latter point the double
  salt will be formed, and the composition of the solution will remain
  unchanged so long as the two solid phases are present. As can be seen
  from the diagram, however, the solution in E contains less of component A
  than is contained in the double salt. Deposition of the double salt at E,
  therefore, would lead to a relative decrease in the concentration of A in
  the solution, and to counterbalance this, <i>the salt which separated out
  at the commencement must redissolve</i>.</p>

  <p>Since the salts were originally present in equimolecular proportions,
  the final result of evaporation will be the pure double salt. If when the
  solution has reached the point E the salt A which had separated out is
  removed, double salt only will be left as solid phase. At a given
  temperature, however, a single solid phase can exist in equilibrium with
  solutions of different composition. If, therefore, isothermal evaporation
  is continued after the removal of the salt A, double salt will be
  deposited, and the composition of the solution will change in the
  direction EF. At the point F the salt B will separate out, and on
  evaporation both double salt and the salt B will be deposited. In the
  former case (when the salt A disappears on evaporation) we are dealing
  with an <i>incongruently saturated solution</i>; but in the latter case,
  where both solid phases continue to be deposited, the solution is said to
  be <i>congruently saturated</i>.<a name="NtA360"
  href="#Nt360"><sup>[360]</sup></a></p>

  <p>A "congruently saturated solution" is one from which the <!-- Page 280
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page280"></a>{280}</span>solid phases
  are continuously deposited during isothermal evaporation to dryness,
  whereas in the case of "incongruently saturated solutions," at least one
  of the solid phases disappears during the process of evaporation.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:17%;">
      <a href="images/fig110.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig110.png"
      alt="Fig. 110" title="Fig. 110" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 110.
  </div>

  <p>Lastly, if the temperature lies outside the transition interval,
  isothermal evaporation of an unsaturated solution of the composition X
  (Fig. 110) will lead to the deposition of pure double salt from beginning
  to end. If a solution of the composition Y is evaporated, the component A
  will first be deposited and the composition of the solution will alter in
  the direction of E, at which point double salt will separate out. Since
  the solution at this point contains relatively more of A than is present
  in the double salt, both the double salt and the single salt A will be
  deposited on continued evaporation, in order that the composition of the
  solution shall remain unchanged. In the case of solution Z, first
  component B and afterwards the double salt will be deposited. The result
  will, therefore, be a mixture of double salt and the salt B (congruently
  saturated solutions),</p>

  <p>It may be stated here that the same relationships as have been
  explained above for double salts are also found in the resolution of
  racemic compounds by means of optically active substances (third method
  of Pasteur). In this case the single salts are doubly active substances
  (<i>e.g.</i> strychnine-<i>d</i>-tartrate and
  strychnine-<i>l</i>-tartrate), and the double salt is a partially racemic
  compound.<a name="NtA361" href="#Nt361"><sup>[361]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Crystallization of Double Salt from Solutions containing Excess of
  One Component.</b>&mdash;One more case of isothermal crystallization may
  be discussed. It is well known that a double salt which is decomposed by
  pure water can nevertheless be obtained pure by crystallization from a
  solution containing excess of one of the single salts (<i>e.g.</i> in the
  case of carnallite). Since the double salt is partially decomposed by
  water, the temperature of the experiment must be within the transition
  <!-- Page 281 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page281"></a>{281}</span>interval, and the relations will,
  therefore, be represented by a diagram like Fig. 109. If, now, instead of
  starting with an unsaturated solution containing the single salts in
  equimolecular proportions, we commence with one in which excess of one of
  the salts is present, as represented by the point Y, isothermal
  evaporation will cause the composition to alter in the direction
  YD&prime;, the relative amounts of the single salts remaining the same
  throughout. When the composition of the solution reaches the point
  D&prime;, pure double salt will be deposited. The separation of double
  salt will, however, cause a relative decrease in the concentration of the
  salt A, and the composition of the solution will, therefore, alter in the
  direction D&prime;F. If the evaporation is discontinued before the
  solution has attained the composition F, only double salt will have
  separated out. Even within the transition interval, therefore, pure
  double salt can be obtained by crystallization, provided the original
  solution has a composition represented by a point lying between the two
  lines OE and OF. Since, as already shown, the composition of the solution
  alters on evaporation in the direction EF, it will be best to employ a
  solution having a composition near to the line OE.</p>

  <p><b>Formation of Mixed Crystals.</b>&mdash;If the two single salts A
  and B do not crystallize out pure from solution, but form an unbroken
  series of mixed crystals, it is evident that an invariant system cannot
  be produced. The solubility curve will therefore be continuous from A to
  B; the liquid solutions of varying composition being in equilibrium with
  solid solutions also of varying composition. If, however, the series of
  mixed crystals is not continuous, there will be a break in the solubility
  curve at which two solid solutions of different composition will be in
  equilibrium with liquid solution. This, of course, will constitute an
  invariant system, and the point will correspond to the point C in Fig.
  108. A full discussion of these systems would, however, lead us too far,
  and the above indication of the behaviour must suffice.<a name="NtA362"
  href="#Nt362"><sup>[362]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page 282 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page282"></a>{282}</span></p>

  <p><b>Application to the Characterization of Racemates.</b>&mdash;The
  form of the isothermal solubility curves is also of great value for
  determining whether an inactive substance is a racemic compound or a
  conglomerate of equal proportions of the optical antipodes.<a
  name="NtA363" href="#Nt363"><sup>[363]</sup></a></p>

  <p>As has already been pointed out, the formation of racemic compounds
  from the two enantiomorphous isomerides, is analogous to the formation of
  double salts. The isothermal solubility curves, also, have a similar
  form. In the case of the latter, indeed, the relationships are simplified
  by the fact that the two enantiomorphous forms have identical solubility,
  and the solubility curves are therefore symmetrical to the line bisecting
  the angle of the co-ordinates. Further, with the exception of the
  partially racemic compounds to be mentioned later, there is no transition
  interval.</p>

  <p>In Fig. 111, are given diagrammatically two isothermal solubility
  curves for optically active substances. From what has been said in the
  immediately preceding pages, the figure ought really to explain itself.
  The upper isothermal <i>acb</i> represents the solubility relations when
  the formation of a racemic compound is excluded, as, <i>e.g.</i> in the
  case of rubidium <i>d</i>- and <i>l</i>-tartrates above the transition
  point (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page265">265</a>). The solution at the point <i>c</i>
  is, of course, inactive, and <i>is unaffected by addition of either the
  </i>d<i>- or </i>l<i>- form</i>. The lower isothermal, on the other hand,
  would be obtained at a temperature at which the racemic compound could be
  formed. The curve <i>a&prime;e</i> is the solubility curve for the
  <i>l</i>- form; <i>b&prime;f</i>, that for the <i>d</i>- form; and
  <i>edf</i>, that for the racemic compound in presence of solutions of
  varying concentration. The point <i>d</i> corresponds to saturation for
  the pure racemic compound.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:20%;">
      <a href="images/fig111.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig111.png"
      alt="Fig. 111" title="Fig. 111" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 111.
  </div>

  <p>From these curves now, it will be evident that it will be possible, in
  any given case, to decide whether or not an inactive body is a mixture or
  a racemic compound. For this purpose, <!-- Page 283 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page283"></a>{283}</span>two solubility
  determinations are made, first with the inactive material alone (in
  excess), and then with the inactive material plus excess of one of the
  optically active forms. If we are dealing with a mixture, the two
  solutions thus obtained will be identical; both will have the composition
  corresponding to the point <i>c</i>, and will be inactive. If, however,
  the inactive material is a racemic compound, then two different solutions
  will be obtained; namely, an inactive solution corresponding to the point
  <i>d</i> (Fig. 111), and an <i>active</i> solution corresponding either
  to <i>e</i> or to <i>f</i>, according to which enantiomorphous form was
  added.</p>

  <p><i>Partially racemic compounds.</i><a name="NtA364"
  href="#Nt364"><sup>[364]</sup></a> In this case we are no longer dealing
  with enantiomorphous forms, and the solubility of the two oppositely
  active isomerides is no longer the same. The symmetry of the solubility
  curves therefore disappears, and a figure is obtained which is identical
  in its general form with that found in the case of ordinary double salts
  (Fig. 112). In this case there is a transition interval.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:19%;">
      <a href="images/fig112.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig112.png"
      alt="Fig. 112" title="Fig. 112" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 112.
  </div>

  <p>The curves <i>acb</i> belong to a temperature at which the partially
  racemic compound cannot be formed; <i>a&prime;dfb&prime;</i>, to the
  temperature at which the compound just begins to be stable in contact
  with water, and <i>a&Prime;ed&prime;f&prime;b&Prime;</i> belongs to a
  temperature at which the partially racemic compound is quite stable in
  contact with water. Suppose now solubility determinations, made in the
  first case with the original material alone, and then with the original
  body plus each of the two compounds, formed from the enantiomorphous
  substances separately, then if the original body was a mixture, identical
  solutions will be obtained in all three cases (point <i>c</i>); if it was
  a partially racemic compound, three different solutions (<i>e</i>,
  <i>d&prime;</i>, and <i>f&prime;</i>) will be obtained if the temperature
  was outside the transition interval, and two solutions, <i>d</i> and
  <i>f</i>, if the temperature belonged to the transition interval.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Representation in Space.</i></p>

  <p><b>Space Model for Carnallite.</b>&mdash;Interesting and important as
  the isothermal solubility curves are, they are insufficient for the
  purpose of obtaining a clear insight into the complete behaviour of the
  systems of two salts and water. A short description will, therefore, be
  given here of the representation in space of the solubility relations of
  potassium and magnesium chlorides, and of the double salt which they
  form, carnallite.<a name="NtA365" href="#Nt365"><sup>[365]</sup></a></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:47%;">
      <a href="images/fig113.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig113.png"
      alt="Fig. 113" title="Fig. 113" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 113.
  </div>

  <p>Fig. 113 is a diagrammatic sketch of the model for carnallite looked
  at sideways from above. Along the X-axis is measured the concentration of
  magnesium chloride in the <!-- Page 285 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page285"></a>{285}</span>solution; along the Y-axis, the
  concentration of potassium chloride; while along the T-axis is measured
  the temperature. The three axes are at right angles to one another. The
  XT-plane, therefore, contains the solubility curve of magnesium chloride;
  the YT-plane, the solubility curve of potassium chloride, and in the
  space between the two planes, there are represented the composition of
  solutions containing both magnesium and potassium chlorides. Any
  <i>surface</i> between the two planes will represent the various
  solutions in equilibrium with only one solid phase, and will therefore
  indicate the area or field of existence of bivariant ternary systems. A
  <i>line</i> or <i>curve</i> formed by the intersection of two surfaces
  will represent solutions in equilibrium with two solid phases (viz. those
  belonging to the intersecting surfaces), and will show the conditions for
  the existence of univariant systems. Lastly, <i>points</i> formed by the
  intersection of three surfaces will represent invariant systems, in which
  a solution can exist in equilibrium with three solid phases (viz. those
  belonging to the three surfaces).</p>

  <p>We shall first consider the solubility relations of the single salts.
  The complete equilibrium curve for magnesium chloride and water is
  represented in Fig. 113 by the series of curves ABF<sub>1</sub>
  G<sub>1</sub> H<sub>1</sub> J<sub>1</sub> L<sub>1</sub> N<sub>1</sub>. AB
  is the freezing-point curve of ice in contact with solutions containing
  magnesium chloride, and B is the cryohydric point at which the solid
  phases ice and MgCl<sub>2</sub>,12H<sub>2</sub>O can co-exist with
  solution. BFG is the solubility curve of magnesium chloride
  dodecahydrate. This curve shows a point of maximum temperature at
  F<sub>1</sub>, and a retroflex portion F<sub>1</sub>G<sub>1</sub>. The
  curve is therefore of the form exhibited by calcium chloride hexahydrate,
  or the hydrates of ferric chloride (Chapter VIII.). G<sub>1</sub> is a
  transition point at which the solid phase changes from dodecahydrate to
  octahydrate, the solubility of which is represented by the curve
  G<sub>1</sub>H<sub>1</sub>. At H<sub>1</sub> the octahydrate gives place
  to the hexahydrate, which is the solid phase in equilibrium with the
  solutions represented by the curve H<sub>1</sub>J<sub>1</sub>.
  J<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>1</sub> are also transition points at which the
  solid phase undergoes change, in the former case from hexahydrate to
  tetrahydrate; and in the latter case, <!-- Page 286 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page286"></a>{286}</span>from tetrahydrate to
  dihydrate. The complete curve of equilibrium for magnesium chloride and
  water is, therefore, somewhat complicated, and is a good example of the
  solubility curves obtained with salts capable of forming several
  hydrates.</p>

  <p>The solubility curve of potassium chloride is of the simplest form,
  consisting only of the two branches AC, the freezing-point curve of ice,
  and CO, the solubility curve of the salt. C is the cryohydric point. This
  point and the two curves lie in the YT-plane.</p>

  <p>On passing to the ternary systems, the composition of the solutions
  must be represented by points or curves situated <i>between</i> the two
  planes. We shall now turn to the consideration of these. BD and CD are
  ternary eutectic curves (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page284">284</a>). They give the
  composition of solutions in equilibrium with ice and magnesium chloride
  dodecahydrate (BD), and with ice and potassium chloride (CD). D is a
  <i>ternary cryohydric point</i>. If the temperature is raised and the ice
  allowed to disappear, we shall pass to the solubility curve for
  MgCl<sub>2</sub>,12H<sub>2</sub>O + KCl (curve DE). At E carnallite is
  formed and the potassium chloride disappears; EFG is then the solubility
  curve for MgCl<sub>2</sub>,12H<sub>2</sub>O + carnallite
  (KMgCl<sub>3</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O). This curve also shows a point of
  maximum temperature (F) and a retroflex portion. GH and HJ represent the
  solubility curves of carnallite + MgCl<sub>2</sub>,8H<sub>2</sub>O and
  carnallite + MgCl<sub>2</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O, G and H being transition
  points. JK is the solubility curve for carnallite +
  MgCl<sub>2</sub>,4H<sub>2</sub>O. At the point K we have the <i>highest
  temperature at which carnallite can exist with magnesium chloride in
  contact with solution</i>. Above this temperature decomposition takes
  place and potassium chloride separates out.</p>

  <p>If at the point E, at which the two single salts and the double salt
  are present, excess of potassium chloride is added, the magnesium
  chloride will all disappear owing to the formation of carnallite, and
  there will be left carnallite and potassium chloride. The solubility
  curve for a mixture of these two salts is represented by EMK; a simple
  curve exhibiting, however, a temperature maximum at M. This maximum point
  corresponds with the fact that dry carnallite melts at this temperature
  with separation of potassium chloride. <i>At all temperatures <!-- Page
  287 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page287"></a>{287}</span>above this
  point, the formation of double salt is impossible</i>. The retroflex
  portion of the curve represents solutions in equilibrium with carnallite
  and potassium chloride, but in which the ratio MgCl<sub>2</sub> : KCl is
  greater than in the double salt.</p>

  <p>Throughout its whole course, <i>the curve EMK represents solutions in
  which the ratio of MgCl<sub>2</sub> : KCl is greater than in the double
  salt</i>. As this is a point of some importance, it will be well,
  perhaps, to make it clearer by giving one of the isothermal curves,
  <i>e.g.</i> the curve for 10°, which is represented diagrammatically in
  Fig. 114. E and F here represent solutions saturated for carnallite plus
  magnesium chloride hydrate, and for carnallite plus potassium chloride.
  As is evident, the point F lies above the line representing equimolecular
  proportions of the salts (OD).</p>

  <p>With the help of the data in the preceding table and of the solid
  model it will be possible to state in any given case what will be the
  behaviour of a system composed of magnesium chloride, potassium chloride
  and water. One or two different cases will be very briefly described; and
  the reader should have no difficulty in working out the behaviour under
  other conditions with the help of the model and the numerical data just
  given. <!-- Page 289 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page289"></a>{289}</span></p>

  <p>In the first place it may be again noted that at a temperature above
  167.5° (point M) carnallite cannot exist. If, therefore, a solution of
  magnesium and potassium chlorides is evaporated at a temperature above
  this point, the result will be a mixture of potassium chloride and either
  magnesium chloride tetrahydrate or magnesium chloride dihydrate,
  according as the temperature is below or above 176°. The isothermal curve
  here consists of only two branches.</p>

  <p>Further, reference has already been made to the fact that all points
  of the carnallite area correspond to solutions in equilibrium with
  carnallite, but in which the ratio of MgCl<sub>2</sub> to KCl is greater
  than in the double salt. A solution which is saturated with respect to
  double salt alone will be supersaturated with respect to potassium
  chloride. At all temperatures, therefore, carnallite is decomposed by
  water with separation of potassium chloride; hence all solutions obtained
  by adding excess of carnallite to water will lie on the curve EM. <i>A
  pure saturated solution of carnallite cannot be obtained.</i></p>

  <p>If an unsaturated solution of the two salts in equimolecular amounts
  is evaporated, potassium chloride will first be deposited, because the
  plane bisecting the right angle formed by the X and Y axes cuts the area
  for that salt. Deposition of potassium chloride will lead to a relative
  increase in the concentration of magnesium chloride in the solution; and
  on continued evaporation a point (on the curve EM) will be reached at
  which carnallite will separate out. So long as the two solid phases are
  present, the composition of the solution must remain unchanged. Since the
  separation of carnallite causes a decrease in the relative concentration
  of the potassium chloride in the solution, the portion of this salt which
  was deposited at the commencement must <i>redissolve</i>, and carnallite
  will be left on evaporating to dryness. (<i>Incongruently saturated
  solution.</i>)</p>

  <p>Although carnallite is decomposed by pure water, it will be possible
  to crystallize it from a solution having a composition represented by any
  point in the carnallite area. Since during the separation of the double
  salt the relative amount of magnesium chloride increases, it is most
  advantageous to <!-- Page 290 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page290"></a>{290}</span>commence with a solution the composition
  of which is represented by a point lying just above the curve EM (cf.
  p.&nbsp;<a href="#page281">281</a>).</p>

  <p>From the above description of the behaviour of carnallite in solution,
  the processes usually employed for obtaining potassium chloride will be
  readily intelligible.<a name="NtA367"
  href="#Nt367"><sup>[367]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Ferric Chloride&mdash;Hydrogen Chloride&mdash;Water.</b>&mdash;In
  the case of another system of three components which we shall now
  describe, the relationships are considerably more complicated than in
  those already discussed. They deserve discussion, however, on account of
  the fact that they exhibit a number of new phenomena.</p>

  <p>In the system formed by the three components, ferric chloride,
  hydrogen chloride, and water, not only can various compounds of ferric
  chloride and water (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page152">152</a>), and of hydrogen
  chloride and water be formed, each of which possesses a definite melting
  point, but various ternary compounds are also known. Thus we have the
  following solid phases:&mdash;</p>

</table>

  <p>From this it will be readily understood that the complete study of the
  conditions of temperature and concentration under which solutions can
  exist, either with one solid phase or with two or three solid phases, are
  exceedingly complicated; and, as a matter of fact, only a few of the
  possible equilibria have been investigated. We shall attempt here only a
  brief description of the most important of these.<a name="NtA368"
  href="#Nt368"><sup>[368]</sup></a></p>

  <p>If we again employ rectangular co-ordinates for the graphic <!-- Page
  291 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page291"></a>{291}</span>representation of the results, we have the
  two planes XOT and YOT (Fig. 115): the concentration of ferric chloride
  being measured along the X-axis, the concentration of hydrogen chloride
  along the Y-axis, and the temperature along the T-axis. The curve
  ABCDEFGHJK is, therefore, the solubility curve of ferric chloride in
  water (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page152">152</a>), and the curve
  A&prime;B&prime;C&prime;D&prime;E&prime;F&prime; the solubility curve of
  hydrogen chloride and its hydrates. B&prime; and D&prime; are the melting
  points of the hydrates HCl,3H<sub>2</sub>O and HCl,2H<sub>2</sub>O. In
  the space between these two planes are represented those systems in which
  all three components are present. As already stated, only a few of the
  possible ternary systems have been investigated, and these are
  represented in Fig. 116. The figure shows the model resting on the
  XOT-plane, so that the lower edge represents the solubility curve of
  ferric chloride, the concentration increasing from right to left. The
  concentration of hydrogen chloride is measured upwards, and the
  temperature forwards. The further end of the model represents the
  isothermal surface for -30°. The surface of the model on the left does
  not correspond with the plane YOT in Fig. 115, but with a parallel plane
  which cuts the concentration axis for ferric chloride at a point
  representing 65 gm.-molecules FeCl<sub>3</sub> in 100 gm.-molecules of
  water. The upper surface corresponds with a plane parallel to the axis
  XOT, at a distance corresponding with the concentration of 50
  gm.-molecules HCl in 100 gm.-molecules of water.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:24%;">
      <a href="images/fig115.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig115.png"

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 115.
  </div>

  <p><b>Ternary Systems.</b>&mdash;We pass over the binary system
  FeCl<sub>3</sub>&mdash;H<sub>2</sub>O, which has already been discussed
  (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page152">152</a>), and the similar system
  HCl&mdash;H<sub>2</sub>O (see Fig. 115), and turn to the discussion of
  some of the ternary systems represented by <!-- Page 292 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page292"></a>{292}</span>points on the surface
  of the model between the planes XOT and YOT. As in the case of
  carnallite, a plane represents the conditions of concentration of
  solution and temperature under which a ternary solution can be in
  equilibrium with a <i>single</i> solid phase (bivariant systems), a line
  represents the conditions for the coexistence of a solution with two
  solid phases (univariant systems), and a point the conditions for
  equilibrium with three solid phases (invariant systems).</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:22%;">
      <a href="images/fig116.jpg"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig116.jpg"
      alt="Fig. 116" title="Fig. 116" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 116.
  </div>

  <p>In the case of a binary system, in which
  2FeCl<sub>3</sub>,12H<sub>2</sub>O is in equilibrium with a solution of
  the same composition, addition of hydrogen chloride must evidently lower
  the temperature at which equilibrium can exist; and the same holds, of
  course, <!-- Page 293 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page293"></a>{293}</span>for all other binary solutions in
  equilibrium with this solid phase. In this way we obtain the surface I.,
  which represents the temperatures and concentrations of solutions in
  which 2FeCl<sub>3</sub>,12H<sub>2</sub>O can be in equilibrium with a
  ternary solution containing ferric chloride, hydrogen chloride, and
  water. This surface is analogous to the curved surface
  K<sub>1</sub>K<sub>2</sub><i>k</i><sub>4</sub><i>k</i><sub>3</sub> in
  Fig. 97 (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page256">256</a>). Similarly, the surfaces II.,
  III., IV., and V. represent the conditions for equilibrium between the
  solid phases 2FeCl<sub>3</sub>,7H<sub>2</sub>O;
  2FeCl<sub>3</sub>,5H<sub>2</sub>O; 2FeCl<sub>3</sub>,4H<sub>2</sub>O;
  FeCl<sub>3</sub> and ternary solutions respectively. The lines CL, EM,
  GN, and IO on the model represent univariant systems in which a ternary
  solution is in equilibrium with two solid phases, viz. with those
  represented by the adjoining fields. These lines correspond with the
  ternary eutectic curves <i>k</i><sub>3</sub>K<sub>1</sub> and
  <i>k</i><sub>4</sub>K<sub>2</sub> in Fig. 97. Besides the surfaces
  already mentioned, there are still three others, VI., VII., and VIII.,
  which also represent the conditions for equilibrium between one solid
  phase and a ternary solution; but in these cases, the solid phase is not
  a binary compound or an anhydrous salt, but a ternary compound containing
  all three components. The solid phases which are in equilibrium with the
  ternary solutions represented by the surfaces VI., VII., and VIII., are
  2FeCl<sub>3</sub>,2HCl,4H<sub>2</sub>O;
  2FeCl<sub>3</sub>,2HCl,8H<sub>2</sub>O; and
  2FeCl<sub>3</sub>,2HCl,12H<sub>2</sub>O respectively.</p>

  <p>The model for FeCl<sub>3</sub>&mdash;HCl&mdash;H<sub>2</sub>O exhibits
  certain other peculiarities not found in the case of
  MgCl<sub>2</sub>&mdash;KCl&mdash;H<sub>2</sub>O. On examining the model
  more closely, it is found that the field of the ternary compound
  2FeCl<sub>3</sub>,2HCl,8H<sub>2</sub>O (VII.) resembles the surface of a
  sugar cone, and has a projecting point, the end of which corresponds with
  a higher temperature than does any other point of the surface. At the
  point of maximum temperature the composition of the liquid phase is the
  same as that of the solid. This point, therefore, represents the melting
  point of the double salt of the above composition.</p>

  <p>The curves representing univariant systems are of two kinds. In the
  one case, the two solid phases present are both binary compounds; or one
  is a binary compound and the other is one of the components. In the other
  case, either one or both solid phases are ternary compounds. Curves
  belonging <!-- Page 294 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page294"></a>{294}</span>to the former class (so-called <i>border
  curves</i>) start from binary eutectic points, and their course is always
  towards lower temperatures, <i>e.g.</i> CL, EM, GN, IO. Curves belonging
  to the latter class (so-called <i>medial curves</i>) would, in a
  triangular diagram, lie entirely within the triangle. Such curves are YV,
  WV, VL, LM, MV, NS, ST, SO, OZ. These curves do not always run from
  higher to lower temperatures, but may even exhibit a point of maximum
  temperature. Such maxima are found, for example, at U (Fig. 116), and
  also on the curves ST and LV.</p>

  <p>Finally, whereas all the other ternary univariant curves run in
  valleys between the adjoining surfaces, we find at the point X a similar
  appearance to that found in the case of carnallite, as the univariant
  curve here rises above the surrounding surface. The point X, therefore,
  does not correspond with a eutectic point, but with a transition point.
  At this point the ternary compound
  2FeCl<sub>3</sub>,2HCl,12H<sub>2</sub>O melts with separation of
  2FeCl<sub>3</sub>,12H<sub>2</sub>O, just as carnallite melts at 168° with
  separation of potassium chloride.</p>

  <p><b>The Isothermal Curves.</b>&mdash;A deeper insight into the
  behaviour of the system FeCl<sub>3</sub>&mdash;HCl&mdash;H<sub>2</sub>O
  is obtained from a study of the isothermal curves, the complete series of
  which, so far as they have been studied, is given in Fig. 117.<a
  name="NtA369" href="#Nt369"><sup>[369]</sup></a> In this figure the
  lightly drawn curves represent isothermal solubility curves, the
  particular temperature being printed beside the curve.<a name="NtA370"
  href="#Nt370"><sup>[370]</sup></a> The dark lines give the composition of
  the univariant systems at different temperatures. The point of
  intersection of a dark with a light curve gives the composition of the
  univariant solution at the temperature represented by the light curve;
  and the point of intersection of two dark lines gives the composition of
  the invariant solution in equilibrium with three solid phases. The dotted
  lines represent metastable systems, and the points P, Q, and R represent
  solutions of <!-- Page 295 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page295"></a>{295}</span>the composition of the ternary salts,
  2FeCl<sub>3</sub>,2HCl,4H<sub>2</sub>O;
  2FeCl<sub>3</sub>,2HCl,8H<sub>2</sub>O; and
  2FeCl<sub>3</sub>,2HCl,12H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:90%;">

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 117.
  </div>

  <p>The farther end of the model (Fig. 116) corresponds, as already
  mentioned, to the temperature -30°, so that the outline evidently
  represents the isothermal curve for that temperature. Fig. 117 does not
  show this. We can, however, follow the isothermal for -20°, which is the
  extreme curve on the right in Fig. 117. Point A represents the solubility
  of 2FeCl<sub>3</sub>,12H<sub>2</sub>O in water. If hydrogen chloride is
  added, the concentration of ferric chloride in the solution first
  decreases and then increases, until at point 34 the ternary double salt
  2FeCl<sub>3</sub>,2HCl,12H<sub>2</sub>O is formed. If the addition of
  hydrogen chloride is continued, the ferric chloride disappears
  ultimately, and only the ternary double salt remains. This salt can
  coexist with solutions of the composition represented by the curve which
  passes through the points 173, 174, 175. At the last-mentioned point, the
  ternary salt with 8H<sub>2</sub>O is formed. The composition of the
  solutions with which this salt is in equilibrium at -20° is represented
  by the curve which passes through a point of maximal concentration with
  respect to HCl, and cuts the curve SN at the point 112, at which the
  solution is in equilibrium with the two solid phases
  2FeCl<sub>3</sub>,4H<sub>2</sub>O and
  2FeCl<sub>3</sub>,2HCl,8H<sub>2</sub>O. The succeeding portion of the
  isotherm represents the solubility curve at -20° of
  2FeCl<sub>3</sub>,4H<sub>2</sub>O, which cuts the dark line OS at point
  113, at which the solution is in equilibrium with the two solid phases
  2FeCl<sub>3</sub>,4H<sub>2</sub>O and
  2FeCl<sub>3</sub>,2HCl,4H<sub>2</sub>O. Thereafter comes the solubility
  curve of the latter compound.</p>

  <p>The other isothermal curves can be followed in a similar manner. If
  the temperature is raised, the region of existence of the ternary double
  salts becomes smaller and smaller, and at temperatures above 30° the
  ternary salts with 12H<sub>2</sub>O and 8H<sub>2</sub>O are no longer
  capable of existing. If the temperature is raised above 46°, only the
  binary compounds of ferric chloride and water and the anhydrous salt can
  exist as solid phases. The isothermal curve for 0° represents the
  solubility curve for 2FeCl<sub>3</sub>,12H<sub>2</sub>O;
  2FeCl<sub>3</sub>,7H<sub>2</sub>O; 2FeCl<sub>3</sub>,5H<sub>2</sub>O; and
  2FeCl<sub>3</sub>,4H<sub>2</sub>O. <!-- Page 296 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page296"></a>{296}</span></p>

  <p>Finally, in the case of the system
  FeCl<sub>3</sub>&mdash;HCl&mdash;H<sub>2</sub>O, we find <i>closed</i>
  isothermal curves. Since, as already stated, the salt
  2FeCl<sub>3</sub>,2HCl,8H<sub>2</sub>O has a definite melting point, the
  temperature of which is therefore higher than that at which this compound
  is in equilibrium with solutions of other composition, it follows that
  the line of intersection of an isothermal plane corresponding with a
  temperature immediately below the melting point of the salt with the
  cone-shaped surface of its region of existence, will form a closed curve.
  This is shown by the isotherm for -4.5°, which surrounds the point Q, the
  melting point of the ternary salt.</p>

  <p><b>Basic Salts.</b>&mdash;Another class of systems in the study of
  <!-- Page 297 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page297"></a>{297}</span>which the Phase Rule has performed
  exceptional service, is that of the basic salts. In many cases it is
  impossible, by the ordinary methods of analysis, to decide whether one is
  dealing with a definite chemical individual or with a mixture. The
  question whether a solid phase is a chemical individual can, however, be
  answered, in most cases, with the help of the principles which we have
  already learnt. Let us consider, for example, the formation of basic
  salts from bismuth nitrate, and water. In this case we can choose as
  components Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, and
  H<sub>2</sub>O; since all the systems consist of these in varying
  amounts. If we are dealing with a condition of equilibrium at constant
  temperature between liquid and solid phases, three cases can be
  distinguished,<a name="NtA371" href="#Nt371"><sup>[371]</sup></a>
  viz.&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. The solutions in different experiments have the same composition,
  but the composition of the precipitate alters. In this case there must be
  two solid phases.</p>

  <p>2. The solutions in different experiments can have varying
  composition, while the composition of the precipitate remains unchanged.
  In this case only one solid phase exists, a definite compound.</p>

  <p>3. The composition both of the solution and of the precipitate varies.
  In this case the solid phase is a solid solution or a mixed crystal.</p>

  <p>In order, therefore, to decide what is the nature of a precipitate
  produced by the hydrolysis of a normal salt, it is only necessary to
  ascertain whether and how the composition of the precipitate alters with
  alteration in the composition of the solution. If the composition of the
  solution is represented by abscissæ, and the composition of the
  precipitate by ordinates, the form of the curves obtained would enable us
  to answer our question; for vertical lines would indicate the presence of
  two solid phases (1st case), horizontal lines the presence of only one
  solid phase (2nd case), and slanting lines the presence of mixed crystals
  (3rd case). This method of representation cannot, however, be carried out
  in most cases. It is, however, <!-- Page 298 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page298"></a>{298}</span>generally possible to find one pair or
  several pairs of components, the <i>relative amounts</i> of which in the
  solution or in the precipitate undergo change when, and only when, the
  composition of the solution or of the precipitate changes. Thus, in the
  case of bismuth, nitrate, and water, we can represent the ratio of
  Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> : N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> in the
  precipitate as ordinates, and N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> : H<sub>2</sub>O
  in the solution as abscissæ. A horizontal line then indicates a single
  solid phase, and a vertical line two solid phases. An example of this is
  given in Fig. 118.<a name="NtA372" href="#Nt372"><sup>[372]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&mdash;N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>&mdash;H<sub>2</sub>O.</b>&mdash;Although
  various systems have been studied in which there is formation of basic
  salts,<a name="NtA373" href="#Nt373"><sup>[373]</sup></a> we shall
  content ourselves here with the description of some of the conditions for
  the formation of basic salts of bismuth nitrate, and for their
  equilibrium in contact with solutions.<a name="NtA374"
  href="#Nt374"><sup>[374]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Three normal salts of bismuth oxide and nitric acid are known, viz.
  Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,3N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>,10H<sub>2</sub>O(S<sub>10</sub>);
  Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,3N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>,4H<sub>2</sub>O(S<sub>4</sub>);
  and
  Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,3N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O(S<sub>3</sub>).
  Besides these normal salts, there are the following basic
  salts:&mdash;</p>

  <p>Probably some others also exist. The problem now is to find the
  conditions under which these different normal and basic salts can be in
  equilibrium with solutions of varying concentration of the three
  components. Having determined the equilibrium conditions for the
  different salts, it is then possible to construct a model similar to that
  for MgCl<sub>2</sub>&mdash;KCl&mdash;H<sub>2</sub>O or for
  FeCl<sub>3</sub>&mdash;HCl&mdash;H<sub>2</sub>O, from which it will be
  possible to determine the limits of stability of the different salts, and
  to predict what will occur when we bring the salts in contact with
  solutions of nitric acid of different concentrations and at different
  temperatures.</p>

  <p>For our present purpose it is sufficient to pick out only some of the
  equilibria which have been studied, and which are represented in the
  model (Fig. 119). In this case use has been made of the triangular method
  of representation, so that the surface of the model lies within the
  prism.</p>

  <!-- Page 300 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page300"></a>{300}</span>temperatures. The front surface of the
  model represents the temperature 9°, and the farther end the temperature
  75.5°. The dotted curve represents the isotherm for 20°. The prominences
  between the surfaces represent, of course, solutions which are saturated
  in respect of two solid phases. Thus, for example, <i>pabc</i> represents
  solutions in equilibrium with B<sub>1-1-1</sub> and S<sub>10</sub>; and
  the ridge <i>qdc</i>, solutions in equilibrium with S<sub>10</sub> and
  S<sub>3</sub>. The point <i>b</i>, which lies at 75.5°, is the point of
  maximum temperature for S<sub>10</sub>. If the temperature is raised
  above this point, S<sub>10</sub> decomposes into the basic salt
  B<sub>1-1-1</sub> and solution. This point is therefore analogous to the
  point M in the carnallite model, at which this salt decomposes into
  potassium chloride and solution (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page284">284</a>); or to
  the point at which the salt 2FeCl<sub>3</sub>,2HCl,12H<sub>2</sub>O
  decomposes into 2FeCl<sub>3</sub>,12H<sub>2</sub>O and solution (p.&nbsp;<a
  href="#page294">294</a>). The curve <i>pab</i> has been followed to the
  temperature of 72° (point <i>c</i>). The end of the model is incomplete,
  but it is probable that in the neighbourhood of the point <i>c</i> there
  exists a quintuple point at which the basic salt B<sub>1-2-2</sub>
  appears. In the neighbourhood of <i>e</i> also there probably exists
  another quintuple point at which S<sub>4</sub> is formed. These systems
  have, however, not been studied.</p>

  <p>Mercuric fluoride does not form any basic salt.</p>

  <p>Since two succeeding members of a series can coexist only in contact
  with a solution of definite concentration, we can prepare acid solutions
  of definite concentration by bringing an excess of two such salts in
  contact with water.</p>

  <p><b>Indirect Determination of the Composition of the Solid
  Phase.</b>&mdash;It has already been shown (p.&nbsp;<a
  href="#page228">228</a>) how the composition of the solid phase in a
  system of two components can be determined without analysis, and we shall
  now describe how this can be done in a system of three components.<a
  name="NtA376" href="#Nt376"><sup>[376]</sup></a></p>

  <p>We shall assume that we are dealing with the aqueous solution of two
  salts which can give rise to a double salt, in which case we can
  represent the solubility relations in a system of rectangular
  co-ordinates. In this case we should obtain, as before (Fig. 120), the
  isotherm <i>adcb</i>, if we express the <!-- Page 303 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page303"></a>{303}</span>composition of the
  solution in gram-molecules of A or of B to 100 gram-molecules of
  water.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:23%;">
      <a href="images/fig120.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig120.png"
      alt="Fig. 120" title="Fig. 120" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 120.</span>
  </div>

  <p>Let us suppose, now, that the double salt is in equilibrium with the
  solution at a definite temperature, and that the composition of the
  solution is represented by the point <i>e</i>. The greater part of the
  solution is now separated from the solid phase, and the latter,
  <i>together with the adhering mother liquor</i>, is analyzed. The
  composition (expressed, as before, in gram-molecules of A and B to 100
  gram molecules of water) will be represented by a point (<i>e.g.</i>
  <i>f</i>) on the line <i>e</i>S, where S represents the composition of
  the double salt. That this is so will be evident when one considers that
  the composition of the whole mass must lie between the composition of the
  solution and that of the double salt, no matter what the relative amounts
  of the solid phase and the mother liquor.</p>

  <p>If, in a similar manner, we analyze a solution of a different
  composition in equilibrium with the same double salt (not necessarily at
  the same temperature as before), and also the mixture of solid phase and
  solution, we shall obtain two other points, as, for example, <i>g</i> and
  <i>h</i>, and the line joining these must likewise pass through S. The
  method of finding the <!-- Page 304 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page304"></a>{304}</span>composition of an unknown double salt
  consists, therefore, in finding, in the manner just described, the
  position of two lines such as <i>ef</i> and <i>gh</i>. The point of
  intersection of these lines then gives the composition of the double
  salt.</p>

  <p>If the double salt is anhydrous, the point S lies at infinity, and the
  lines <i>ef</i> and <i>gh</i> are parallel to each other.</p>

  <p>The same result is arrived at by means of the triangular method of
  representation.<a name="NtA377" href="#Nt377"><sup>[377]</sup></a> If we
  start with the three components in known amounts, and represent the
  initial composition of the whole by a point in the triangle, and then
  ascertain the final composition of the solution in equilibrium with the
  solid phase at a definite temperature, the line joining the points
  representing the initial and end concentration passes through the point
  representing the composition of the solid phase. If two determinations
  are made with solutions having different initial and final concentrations
  in equilibrium with the same solid phase, then the point of intersection
  of the two lines so obtained gives the composition of the solid
  phase.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVII</h3>

<p class="cenhead">ABSENCE OF A LIQUID PHASE</p>

  <p>In the preceding chapters dealing with equilibria in three-component
  systems, our attention was directed only to those cases in which liquid
  solutions formed one or more phases. Mention must, however, be made of
  certain systems which contain no liquid phase, and in which only solids
  and gases are in equilibrium. Since, in all cases, there can be but one
  gas phase, four solid phases will be necessary in order to form an
  invariant system. When only three solid phases are present, the system is
  univariant; and when only two solid phases coexist with gas, it is
  bivariant. If, however, we make the restriction that the gas pressure is
  constant, we diminish the variability by one.</p>

  <p>On account of their great industrial importance, we shall describe
  briefly some of the systems belonging to this class.</p>

  <p><b>Iron, Carbon Monoxide, Carbon Dioxide.</b>&mdash;Some of the most
  important systems of three components in which equilibrium exists between
  solid and gas phases are those formed by the three components&mdash;iron,
  carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide&mdash;and they are of importance
  especially for the study of the processes occurring in the blast
  furnace.</p>

  <p>If carbon monoxide is passed over reduced iron powder at a temperature
  of about 600°, the iron is oxidized and the carbon monoxide reduced with
  separation of carbon in accordance with the equation</p>

<p class="cenhead">Fe + CO = FeO + C</p>

  <p>This reaction is succeeded by the two reactions</p>

<p class="cenhead">FeO + CO = Fe + CO<sub>2</sub><br />
CO<sub>2</sub> + C = 2CO</p>

<p><!-- Page 306 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page306"></a>{306}</span></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:44%;">
      <a href="images/fig121.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig121.png"
      alt="Fig. 121" title="Fig. 121" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 121.</span>
  </div>

  <p>The former of these reactions is not complete, but leads to a definite
  equilibrium. The result of the different reactions is therefore an
  equilibrium between the three solid phases, carbon, iron, and ferrous
  oxide, and the gas phase consisting of carbon monoxide and dioxide. We
  have here four phases; and if the total pressure is maintained constant,
  equilibrium can occur only at a definite temperature.</p>

  <p>Since, under certain conditions, we can also have the reaction</p>

<p class="cenhead">Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> + CO = 3FeO + CO<sub>2</sub></p>

<p><!-- Page 307 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page307"></a>{307}</span></p>

  <p>a second series of equilibria can be obtained of a character similar
  to the former. These various equilibria have been investigated by Baur
  and Glaessner,<a name="NtA378" href="#Nt378"><sup>[378]</sup></a> and the
  following is a short account of the results of their work.</p>

  <p>Mixtures of the solid phases in equilibrium with carbon monoxide and
  dioxide were heated in a porcelain tube at a definite temperature until
  equilibrium was produced, and the gas was then pumped off and analyzed.
  The results which were obtained are given in the following tables, and
  represented graphically in Fig. 121.</p>

  <p>As is evident from the above tables and from the curves in Fig. 121,
  the curve of equilibrium in the case of the reaction</p>

<p class="cenhead">Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> + CO = 3FeO + CO<sub>2</sub></p>

  <p>exhibits a maximum for the ratio CO : CO<sub>2</sub>, at 490°, while,
  for the reaction</p>

<p class="cenhead">FeO + CO = Fe + CO<sub>2</sub></p>

  <p>this ratio has a minimum value at 680°. From these curves can be
  derived the conditions under which the different solid phases can exist
  in contact with gas. Thus, for example, at a temperature of 690°, FeO and
  Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> can coexist with a mixture of 65.5 per cent.
  of CO<sub>2</sub> and 34.5 per cent. of CO. If the partial pressure of
  CO<sub>2</sub> is increased, there occurs the reaction</p>

<p class="cenhead">3FeO + CO<sub>2</sub> = Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> + CO</p>

  <p>and if carbon dioxide is added in sufficient amount, the ferrous oxide
  finally disappears completely. If, on the other hand, the partial
  pressure of CO is increased, there occurs the reaction</p>

<p class="cenhead">Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> + CO = 3FeO + CO<sub>2</sub></p>

  <p>and all the ferric oxide can be made to disappear. We see, therefore,
  that Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> can only exist at temperatures and in
  <!-- Page 309 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page309"></a>{309}</span>contact with mixtures of carbon monoxide
  and dioxide, represented by the area which lies below the under curve in
  Fig. 121. Similarly, the region of existence of FeO is that represented
  by the area between the two curves; while metallic iron can exist under
  the conditions of temperature and composition of gas phase represented by
  the area above the upper curve in Fig. 121. If, therefore, ferric oxide
  or metallic iron is heated for a sufficiently long time at temperatures
  above 700° (to the right of the dotted line; <i>vide infra</i>), complete
  transformation to ferrous oxide finally occurs.</p>

  <p>In another series of equilibria which can be obtained, carbon is one
  of the solid phases. In Fig. 121 the equilibria between carbon, carbon
  monoxide, and carbon dioxide under pressures of one and of a quarter
  atmosphere, are represented by dotted lines.<a name="NtA379"
  href="#Nt379"><sup>[379]</sup></a></p>

  <p>If we consider only the dotted line on the right, representing the
  equilibria under atmospheric pressure, we see that the points in which
  the dotted line cuts the other two curves must represent systems in which
  carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are in equilibrium with FeO +
  Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> + C, on the one hand, and with Fe + FeO + C
  on the other. These systems can only exist at one definite temperature,
  if we make the restriction that the pressure is maintained constant
  (atmospheric pressure). Starting, therefore, with the equilibrium FeO +
  Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> + CO + CO<sub>2</sub> at a temperature of
  about 670°, and then add carbon to the system, the reaction</p>

<p class="cenhead">C + CO<sub>2</sub> = 2CO</p>

  <p>will occur, because the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> is greater
  than what corresponds with the system FeO + Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> +
  C in equilibrium with carbon monoxide and dioxide. In consequence of this
  reaction, the equilibrium between FeO + Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and
  the gas phase is disturbed, and the change in the composition of the gas
  phase is opposed by the reaction Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> + CO = 3FeO
  + CO<sub>2</sub>, which continues until either all the carbon <!-- Page
  310 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page310"></a>{310}</span>or all the
  ferric oxide is used up. If the ferric oxide first disappears, the
  equilibrium corresponds with a point on the dotted line in the middle
  area of Fig. 121, which represents equilibria between FeO + C as solid
  phases, and a mixture of carbon monoxide and dioxide as gas phase. If the
  temperature is higher than 685°, at which temperature the curve for
  C&mdash;CO&mdash;CO<sub>2</sub> cuts that for
  Fe&mdash;FeO&mdash;CO&mdash;CO<sub>2</sub>; then, when all the ferric
  oxide has disappeared, the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> is still too
  great for the coexistence of FeO and C. Consequently, there occurs the
  reaction C + CO<sub>2</sub> = 2CO, and the composition of the gas phase
  alters until a point on the upper curve is reached. A further increase in
  the concentration of CO is opposed by the reaction FeO + CO = Fe +
  CO<sub>2</sub>, and the pressure remains constant until all the ferrous
  oxide is reduced and only iron and carbon remain in equilibrium with gas.
  If the quantities of the substances have been rightly chosen, we
  ultimately reach a point on the dotted curve in the upper part of Fig.
  121.</p>

  <p>Fig. 121 shows us, also, what are the conditions under which the
  reduction of ferric to ferrous oxide by carbon can occur. Let us suppose,
  for example, that we start with a mixture of carbon monoxide and dioxide
  at about 600° (the lowest point on the dotted line), and maintain the
  total pressure constant and equal to one atmosphere. If the temperature
  is increased, the concentration of the carbon dioxide will diminish,
  owing to the reaction C + CO<sub>2</sub> = 2CO, but the ferric oxide will
  undergo no change until the temperature reaches 647°, the point of
  intersection of the dotted curve with the curve for FeO and
  Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. At this point further increase in the
  concentration of carbon monoxide is opposed by the reduction of ferric
  oxide in accordance with the equation Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> + CO =
  3FeO + CO<sub>2</sub>. The pressure, therefore, remains constant until
  all the ferric oxide has disappeared. If the temperature is still further
  raised, we again obtain a univariant system, FeO + C, in equilibrium with
  gas (univariant because the total pressure is constant); and if the
  temperature is raised the composition of the gas must undergo change.
  This is effected by the reaction C + CO<sub>2</sub> = 2CO. When the <!--
  Page 311 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page311"></a>{311}</span>temperature rises to 685°, at which the
  dotted curve cuts the curve for Fe&mdash;FeO, further change is prevented
  by the reaction FeO + CO = Fe + CO<sub>2</sub>. When all the ferrous
  oxide is used up, we obtain the system Fe + C in equilibrium with gas. If
  the temperature is now raised, the composition of the gas undergoes
  change, as shown by the dotted line. The two temperatures, 647° and 685°,
  give, evidently, the limits within which ferric or ferrous oxide can be
  reduced directly by carbon.</p>

  <p>It is further evident that at any temperature to the right of the
  dotted line, carbon is unstable in presence of iron or its oxides; while
  at temperatures lower than those represented by the dotted line, it is
  stable. In the blast furnace, therefore, separation of carbon can occur
  only at lower temperatures, and the carbon must disappear on raising the
  temperature.</p>

  <p>Finally, it may be remarked that the equilibrium curves show that
  ferrous oxide is most easily reduced at 680°, since the concentration of
  the carbon monoxide required at this temperature is a minimum. On the
  other hand, ferric oxide is reduced with greatest difficulty at 490°,
  since at this temperature the requisite concentration of carbon monoxide
  is a maximum.</p>

  <p>Other equilibria between solid and gas phases are: Equilibrium between
  iron, ferric oxide, water vapour, and hydrogen,<a name="NtA380"
  href="#Nt380"><sup>[380]</sup></a> and the equilibria between carbon,
  carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, water vapour, and hydrogen,<a

<h3>CHAPTER XVIII</h3>

<p class="cenhead">SYSTEMS OF FOUR COMPONENTS</p>

  <p>In the systems which have so far been studied, we have met with cases
  where two or three components could enter into combination; but in no
  case did we find double decomposition occurring. The reason of this is
  that in the systems previously studied, in which double decomposition
  might have been possible, namely in those systems in which two salts
  acted as components, the restriction was imposed that either the basic or
  the acid constituent of these salts must be the same; a restriction
  imposed, indeed, for the very purpose of excluding double decomposition.
  Now, however, we shall allow this restriction to fall, thereby extending
  the range of study.</p>

  <p>Hitherto, in connection with four-component systems, the attention has
  been directed solely to the study of aqueous solutions of salts, and more
  especially of the salts which occur in sea-water, <i>i.e.</i> chiefly,
  the sulphates and chlorides of magnesium, potassium, and sodium. The
  importance of these investigations will be recognized when one recollects
  that by the evaporation of sea-water there have been formed the enormous
  salt-beds at Stassfurt, which constitute at present the chief source of
  the sulphates and chlorides of magnesium and potassium. The
  investigations, therefore, are not only of great geological interest as
  tending to elucidate the conditions under which these salt-beds have been
  formed, but are of no less importance for the industrial working of the
  deposits.</p>

  <p>It is, however, not the intention to enter here into any detailed
  description of the different systems which have so far been studied, and
  of the sometimes very complex relationships <!-- Page 313 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page313"></a>{313}</span>met with, but merely to
  refer briefly to some points of more general import in connection with
  these systems.<a name="NtA382" href="#Nt382"><sup>[382]</sup></a></p>

  salts undergo double decomposition, the interaction can be expressed by
  an equation such as</p>

<p class="cenhead">NH<sub>4</sub>Cl + NaNO<sub>3</sub> = NaCl + NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub></p>

  <p>Since one pair of salts&mdash;NaCl +
  NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>&mdash;is formed from the other
  pair&mdash;NH<sub>4</sub>Cl + NaNO<sub>3</sub>&mdash;by double
  decomposition, the two pairs of salts are known as <i>reciprocal
  salt-pairs</i>.<a name="NtA383" href="#Nt383"><sup>[383]</sup></a> It is
  with systems in which the component salts form reciprocal salt-pairs that
  we have to deal here.</p>

  <p>It must be noted, however, that the four salts formed by two
  reciprocal salt-pairs do not constitute a system of four, but only of
  <i>three</i> components. This will be understood if it is recalled that
  only so many constituents are taken as components as are necessary to
  <i>express</i> the composition of all the phases present (p.&nbsp;<a
  href="#page12">12</a>). It will be seen, now, that the composition of
  each of the four salts which can be present together can be expressed in
  terms of three of them. Thus, for example, in the case of
  NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, NaNO<sub>3</sub>, NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>, NaCl,
  we can express the composition of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl by
  NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> + NaCl - NaNO<sub>3</sub>; or of
  NaNO<sub>3</sub> by NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> + NaCl -
  NH<sub>4</sub>Cl. In all these cases it will be seen that negative
  quantities of one of the components must be employed; but that we have
  seen to be quite permissible (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page12">12</a>). The number of
  components is, therefore, three; but any three of the four salts can be
  chosen.</p>

  <p>Since, then, two reciprocal salt-pairs constitute only three <!-- Page
  314 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page314"></a>{314}</span>components
  or independently variable constituents, another component is necessary in
  order to obtain a four-component system. As such, we shall choose
  water.</p>

  <p><b>Transition Point.</b>&mdash;In the case of the formation of double
  salts from two single salts, we saw that there was a point&mdash;the
  <i>quintuple point</i>&mdash;at which five phases could coexist. This
  point we also saw to be a transition point, on one side of which the
  double salt, on the other side the two single salts in contact with
  solution, were found to be the stable system. A similar behaviour is
  found in the case of reciprocal salt-pairs. The four-component system,
  two reciprocal salt-pairs and water, can give rise to an invariant system
  in which the six phases, four salts, solution, vapour, can coexist; the
  temperature at which this is possible constitutes a <i>sextuple
  point</i>. Now, this sextuple point is also a transition point, on the
  one side of which the one salt-pair, on the other side the reciprocal
  salt-pair, is stable in contact with solution.</p>

  <p>The sextuple point is the point of intersection of the curves of six
  univariant systems, viz. four solubility curves with three solid phases
  each, a vapour-pressure curve for the system: two reciprocal
  salt-pairs&mdash;vapour; and a transition curve for the condensed system:
  two reciprocal salt-pairs&mdash;solution. If we omit the vapour phase and
  work under atmospheric pressure (in open vessels), we find that the
  transition point is the point of intersection of four solubility
  curves.</p>

  <p>Just as in the case of three-component systems we saw that the
  presence of one of the single salts along with the double salt was
  necessary in order to give a univariant system, so in the four-component
  systems the presence of a third salt is necessary as solid phase along
  with one of the salt-pairs. In the case of the reciprocal salt-pairs
  mentioned above, the transition point would be the point of intersection
  of the solubility curves of the systems with the following groups of
  salts as solid phases: Below the transition point: NH<sub>4</sub>Cl +
  NaNO<sub>3</sub> + NaCl; NH<sub>4</sub>Cl + NaNO<sub>3</sub> +
  NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>; above the transition point: NaCl +
  NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> + NaNO<sub>3</sub>; NaCl +
  NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> + NH<sub>4</sub>Cl. From this we see that
  the two salts NH<sub>4</sub>Cl and NaNO<sub>3</sub> would be able to
  exist together with solution below the transition point, but not above
  it. This transition point has not been determined. <!-- Page 315 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page315"></a>{315}</span></p>

  <p><b>Formation of Double Salts.</b>&mdash;In all cases of four-component
  systems so far studied, the transition points have not been points at
  which one salt-pair passed into its reciprocal, but at which a double
  salt was formed. Thus, at 4.4° Glauber's salt and potassium chloride form
  glaserite and sodium chloride, according to the equation</p>

<p class="cenhead">2Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,10H<sub>2</sub>O + 3KCl = K<sub>3</sub>Na(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + 3NaCl + 20H<sub>2</sub>O</p>

  <p>Above the transition point, therefore, there would be
  K<sub>3</sub>Na(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, NaCl and KCl; and it may be
  considered that at a higher temperature the double salt would interact
  with the potassium chloride according to the equation</p>

<p class="cenhead">K<sub>3</sub>Na(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + KCl = 2K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + NaCl</p>

  <p>thus giving the reciprocal of the original salt-pair. This point has,
  however, not been experimentally realized.<a name="NtA384"
  href="#Nt384"><sup>[384]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>Transition Interval.</b>&mdash;A double salt, we learned (p.&nbsp;<a
  href="#page277">277</a>), when brought in contact with water at the
  transition point undergoes partial decomposition with separation of one
  of the constituent salts; and only after a certain range of temperature
  (transition interval) has been passed, can a pure saturated solution be
  obtained. A similar behaviour is also found in the case of reciprocal
  salt-pairs. If one of the salt-pairs is brought in contact with water at
  the transition point, interaction will occur and one of the salts of the
  reciprocal salt-pair will be deposited; and this will be the case
  throughout a certain range of temperature, after which it will be
  possible to prepare a solution saturated only for the one salt-pair. In
  the case of ammonium chloride and sodium nitrate the lower limit of the
  transition interval is 5.5°, so that above this temperature and up to
  that of the transition point (unknown), ammonium chloride and sodium
  nitrate in contact with water would give rise to a third salt by double
  decomposition, in this case to sodium chloride.<a name="NtA385"

  <p><b>Graphic Representation.</b>&mdash;For the graphic representation of
  systems of four components, four axes may be chosen intersecting at a
  point like the edges of a regular octahedron (Fig. 122).<a name="NtA386"
  href="#Nt386"><sup>[386]</sup></a> Along these different axes the
  equivalent molecular amounts of the different salts are measured.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:19%;">
      <a href="images/fig123.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig123.png"
      alt="Fig. 123" title="Fig. 123" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 123.

  <div class="figright" style="width:21%;">
      <a href="images/fig122.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig122.png"

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 122.
  </div>

  <p>To represent a given system consisting of <i>x</i>B, <i>y</i>C, and
  <i>z</i>D in a given amount of water (where B, C, and D represent
  equivalent molecular amounts of the salts), measure off on OB and OC
  lengths equal to <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> respectively. The point of
  intersection <i>a</i> (Fig. 122) represents a solution containing
  <i>x</i>B and <i>y</i>C (<i>ab</i> = <i>x</i>; <i>ac</i> = <i>y</i>).
  From <i>a</i> a line <i>a</i>P is drawn parallel to OD and equal to
  <i>z</i>. P then represents the solution of the above composition.</p>

  <p>It is usual, however, not to employ the three-dimensional figure, but
  its horizontal and vertical projections. Fig. 122, if projected on the
  base of the octahedron, would yield a diagram such as is shown in Fig.
  123. The projection of the edges of the octahedron form two axes at right
  angles and give rise to four quadrants similar to those employed for the
  representation of ternary solutions (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page273">273</a>).
  Here, the point <i>a</i> represents a ternary solution saturated with
  respect to B and C; and <i>a</i>P, quaternary solutions in equilibrium
  with the same two salts as solid phases. Such a diagram represents the
  conditions of equilibrium only for one definite temperature, and
  corresponds, therefore, to the isothermal diagrams for ternary systems
  (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page273">273</a>). In such a diagram, since the temperature
  and <!-- Page 317 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page317"></a>{317}</span>pressure are constant (vessels open to the
  air), a surface will represent a solution in equilibrium with only one
  solid phase; a line, a solution with two solid phases, and a point, one
  in equilibrium with three solid phases.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 124.
  </div>

  <p><b>Example.</b>&mdash;As an example of the complete isothermal
  diagram, there may be given one representing the equilibria in the system
  composed of water and the reciprocal salt-pair sodium
  sulphate&mdash;potassium chloride for the temperature 0° (Fig. 124).<a
  name="NtA387" href="#Nt387"><sup>[387]</sup></a> The amounts of the
  different salts are measured along the four axes, and the composition of
  the solution is <!-- Page 318 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page318"></a>{318}</span>expressed in equivalent gram-molecules per
  1000 gram-molecules of water.<a name="NtA388"
  href="#Nt388"><sup>[388]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The outline of this figure represents four ternary solutions in which
  the component salts have a common acid or basic constituent; viz. sodium
  chloride&mdash;sodium sulphate, sodium sulphate&mdash;potassium sulphate,
  potassium sulphate&mdash;potassium chloride, potassium
  chloride&mdash;sodium chloride. These four sets of curves are therefore
  similar to those discussed in the previous chapter. In the case of sodium
  and potassium sulphate, a double salt, <i>glaserite</i>
  [K<sub>3</sub>Na(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] is formed. Whether
  glaserite is really a definite compound or not is still a matter of
  doubt, since isomorphic mixtures of Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and
  K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> have been obtained. According to van't Hoff
  and Barscholl,<a name="NtA389" href="#Nt389"><sup>[389]</sup></a>
  glaserite is an isomorphous mixture; but Gossner<a name="NtA390"
  href="#Nt390"><sup>[390]</sup></a> considers it to be a definite compound
  having the formula K<sub>3</sub>Na(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. Points
  VIII. and IX. represent solutions saturated with respect to glaserite and
  sodium sulphate, and glaserite and potassium sulphate respectively.</p>

  <p>The lines which pass inwards from these boundary curves represent
  solutions containing three salts, but in contact with only two solid
  phases; and the points where three lines meet, or where three fields
  meet, represent solutions in equilibrium with three solid phases; with
  the phases, namely, belonging to the three concurrent fields.</p>

  <p>If it is desired to represent a solution containing the salts say in
  the proportions, 51Na<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>,
  9.5K<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, 3.5K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, the
  difficulty is met with that two of the salts, sodium chloride and
  potassium sulphate, lie on opposite axes. To overcome this difficulty the
  difference 51 - 3.5 = 47.5 is taken and measured off along the sodium
  chloride axis; and the solution is therefore represented by the point
  47.5Na<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, 9.5K<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>. In
  order, therefore, to find the amount of potassium sulphate present <!--
  Page 319 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page319"></a>{319}</span>from
  such a diagram, it is necessary to know the total number of salt
  molecules in the solution. When this is known, it is only necessary to
  subtract from it the sum of the molecules of sodium and potassium
  chloride, and the result is equal to twice the number of potassium
  sulphate molecules. Thus, in the above example, the total number of salt
  molecules is 64. The number of molecules of sodium and potassium chloride
  is 57; 64 - 57 = 7, and therefore the number of potassium sulphate
  molecules is 3.5.</p>

  <p>Another method of representation employed is to indicate the amounts
  of only two of the salts in a plane diagram, and to measure off the total
  number of molecules along a vertical axis. In this way a solid model is
  obtained.</p>

  solutions at 0°:&mdash;<a name="NtA391"

  <p>From the aspect of these diagrams the conditions under which the salts
  can coexist can be read at a glance. Thus, <!-- Page 320 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page320"></a>{320}</span>for example, Fig. 124
  shows that at 0° Glauber's salt and potassium chloride can exist together
  with solution; namely, in contact with solutions having the composition
  X&mdash;XI. This temperature must therefore be below the transition point
  of this salt-pair (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page314">314</a>). On raising the
  temperature to 4.4°, it is found that the curve VIII.&mdash;XI. moves so
  that the point XI. coincides with point X. At this point, therefore,
  there will be <i>four</i> concurrent fields, viz. Glauber's salt,
  potassium chloride, glaserite, and sodium chloride. But these four salts
  can coexist with solution only at the transition point; so that 4.4° is
  the transition temperature of the salt-pair: Glauber's
  salt&mdash;potassium chloride. At higher temperatures the line
  VIII.&mdash;XI. moves still further to the left, so that the field for
  Glauber's salt becomes entirely separated from the field for potassium
  chloride. This shows that at temperatures above the transition point the
  salt-pair Glauber's salt&mdash;potassium chloride cannot coexist in
  presence of solution.</p>

  <p>If it is only desired to indicate the mutual relationships of the
  different components and the conditions for their coexistence
  (<i>paragenesis</i>), a simpler diagram than Fig. 124 can be employed.
  Thus if the boundary curves of Fig. 124 are so drawn that they cut one
  another at right angles, a figure such as Fig. 125 is obtained, the Roman
  numerals here corresponding with those in Fig. 124.</p>

  <p><b>Ammonia-Soda Process.</b>&mdash;One of the most important
  applications of the Phase Rule to systems of four components with
  reciprocal salt-pairs has recently been made by Fedotieff<a name="NtA392"
  href="#Nt392"><sup>[392]</sup></a> in his investigations of the
  conditions for the formation of sodium carbonate by the so-called
  ammonia-soda (Solvay) <!-- Page 321 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page321"></a>{321}</span>process.<a name="NtA393"
  href="#Nt393"><sup>[393]</sup></a> This process consists, as is well
  known, in passing carbon dioxide through a solution of common salt
  saturated with ammonia.</p>

  <p>Whatever differences of detail there may be in the process as carried
  out in different manufactories, the reaction which forms the basis of the
  process is that represented by the equation</p>

<p class="cenhead">NaCl + NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> = NaHCO<sub>3</sub> + NH<sub>4</sub>Cl</p>

  <p>We are dealing here, therefore, with reciprocal salt-pairs, the
  behaviour of which has just been discussed in the preceding pages. The
  present case is, however, simpler than that of the salt-pair
  Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.10H<sub>2</sub>O + KCl, inasmuch as under
  the conditions of experiment neither hydrates nor double salts are
  formed. Since the study of the reaction is rendered more difficult on
  account of the fact that ammonium bicarbonate in solution, when under
  atmospheric pressure, undergoes decomposition at temperatures above 15°,
  this temperature was the one chosen for the detailed investigation of the
  conditions of equilibrium. Since, further, it has been shown by
  Bodländer<a name="NtA394" href="#Nt394"><sup>[394]</sup></a> that the
  bicarbonates possess a definite solubility only when the pressure of
  carbon dioxide in the solution has a definite value, the measurements
  were carried out in solutions saturated with this gas. This, however,
  does not constitute another component, because we have made the
  restriction that the sum of the partial pressures of carbon dioxide and
  water vapour is equal to 1 atmosphere. The concentration of the carbon
  dioxide is, therefore, not independently variable (p.&nbsp;<a

  <p>In order to obtain the data necessary for a discussion of the
  conditions of soda formation by the ammonia-soda process, solubility
  determinations with the four salts, NaCl, NH<sub>4</sub>Cl,
  NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>, and NaHCO<sub>3</sub> were made, first
  with the single salts and then <!-- Page 322 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page322"></a>{322}</span>with the salts in pairs. The results
  obtained are represented graphically in Fig. 126, which is an isothermal
  diagram similar to that given by Fig. 124. The points I., II., III., IV.,
  represent the composition of solutions in equilibrium with two solid
  salts. We have, however, seen (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page314">314</a>) that the
  transition point, when the experiment is carried out under constant
  pressure (atmospheric pressure), is the point of intersection of four
  solubility curves, each of which represents the composition of solutions
  in equilibrium with three salts, viz. one of the reciprocal salt-pairs
  along with a third salt. Since, now, it was found that the stable
  salt-pair at temperatures between 0° and 30° is sodium bicarbonate and
  ammonium chloride, determinations were made of the composition of
  solutions in equilibrium with NaHCO<sub>3</sub> + NH<sub>4</sub>Cl +
  NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> and with NaHCO<sub>3</sub> +
  NH<sub>4</sub>Cl + NaCl as solid phases. Under the <!-- Page 323 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page323"></a>{323}</span>conditions of
  experiment (temperature = 15°) sodium chloride and ammonium bicarbonate
  cannot coexist in contact with solution. These determinations gave the
  data necessary for the construction of the complete isothermal diagram
  (Fig. 127). The most important of these data are given in the following

  <p>With reference to the solution represented by the point P<sub>1</sub>,
  it may be remarked that it is an incongruently saturated solution (p.&nbsp;<a
  href="#page279">279</a>). If sodium chloride is added to this solution,
  the composition of the latter undergoes change; and if a sufficient
  amount of the salt is added, the solution P<sub>2</sub> is obtained.</p>

  <p>Turning now to the practical application of the data so obtained,
  consider first what is the influence of concentration on the yield of
  soda. Since the reaction consists essentially in a double decomposition
  between sodium chloride and ammonium bicarbonate, then, after the
  deposition of the sodium bicarbonate, we obtain a solution containing
  sodium chloride, ammonium chloride, and sodium bicarbonate. In order to
  ascertain to what extent the sodium chloride has been converted into
  solid sodium bicarbonate, it is necessary to examine the composition of
  the solution which is obtained <!-- Page 324 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page324"></a>{324}</span>with definite amounts of sodium chloride
  and ammonium bicarbonate.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:43%;">

  <p>Consider, in the first place, the solutions represented by the curve
  P<sub>2</sub>P<sub>1</sub>. With the help of this curve we can state the
  conditions under which a solution, saturated for ammonium chloride, is
  obtained, after deposition of sodium bicarbonate. In the following table
  the composition of the solutions is given which are obtained with
  different initial amounts of sodium chloride and ammonium bicarbonate.
  The last two columns give the percentage amount of the sodium used, which
  is deposited as solid sodium bicarbonate (U<sub>Na</sub>); and likewise
  the percentage amount of ammonium bicarbonate which is usefully converted
  into sodium bicarbonate, that is to say, the amount of the radical
  HCO<sub>3</sub> deposited (U<sub>NH<sub>4</sub></sub>):&mdash; <!-- Page

  <p>This table shows that the greater the excess of sodium chloride, the
  greater is the percentage utilization of ammonia (Point P<sub>2</sub>);
  and the more the amount of sodium chloride decreases, the greater is the
  percentage amount of sodium chloride converted into bicarbonate. In the
  latter case, however, the percentage utilization of the ammonium
  bicarbonate decreases; that is to say, less sodium bicarbonate is
  deposited, or more of it remains in solution.</p>

  <p>Consider, in the same manner, the relations for solutions represented

  <p>As is evident from this table, diminution in the relative amount of
  sodium chloride exercises only a slight influence <!-- Page 326 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page326"></a>{326}</span>on the utilization of
  this salt, but is accompanied by a rapid diminution of the effective
  transformation of the ammonium bicarbonate. So far as the efficient
  conversion of the sodium is concerned, we see that it reaches its maximum
  at the point P<sub>1</sub>, and that it decreases both with increase and
  with decrease of the relative amount of sodium chloride employed; and
  faster, indeed, in the former than in the latter case. On the other hand,
  the effective transformation of the ammonium bicarbonate reaches its
  maximum at the point P<sub>2</sub>, and diminishes with increase in the
  relative amount of ammonium bicarbonate employed. Since sodium chloride
  is, in comparison with ammonia&mdash;even when this is
  regenerated&mdash;a cheap material, it is evidently more advantageous to
  work with solutions which are relatively rich in sodium chloride
  (solutions represented by the curve P<sub>1</sub>P<sub>2</sub>). This
  fact has also been established empirically.</p>

  <p>When, as is the case in industrial practice, we are dealing with
  solutions which are saturated not for two salts but only for sodium
  bicarbonate, it is evident that we have then to do with solutions the
  composition of which is represented by points in the area
  P<sub>1</sub>P<sub>2</sub>I,IV. Since in the commercial manufacture, the
  aim must be to obtain as complete a utilization of the materials as
  possible, the solutions employed industrially must lie in the
  neighbourhood of the curves P<sub>2</sub>P<sub>1</sub>IV, as is indicated
  by the shaded portion in Fig. 127. The best results, from the
  manufacturer's standpoint, will be obtained, as already stated, when the
  composition of the solutions approaches that given by a point on the
  curve P<sub>2</sub>P<sub>1</sub>. Considered from the chemical
  standpoint, the results of the experiments lead to the conclusion that
  the Solvay process, <i>i.e.</i> passage of carbon dioxide through a
  solution of sodium chloride saturated with ammonia, is not so good as the
  newer method of Schlösing, which consists in bringing together sodium
  chloride and ammonium bicarbonate with water.<a name="NtA395"

<p><!-- Page 327 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page327"></a>{327}</span></p>

  <p><b>Preparation of Barium Nitrite.</b>&mdash;Mention may also be made
  here of the preparation of barium nitrite by double decomposition of
  barium chloride and sodium nitrite.<a name="NtA396"
  href="#Nt396"><sup>[396]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The reaction with which we are dealing here is represented by the
  equation</p>

<p class="cenhead">BaCl<sub>2</sub> + 2NaNO<sub>2</sub> = 2NaCl + Ba(NO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub></p>

  <p>It was found that at the ordinary temperature NaCl and
  Ba(NO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub> form the stable salt-pair. If, therefore,
  barium chloride and sodium nitrite are brought together with an amount of
  water insufficient for complete solution, transformation to the stable
  salt-pair occurs, and sodium chloride and barium nitrite are deposited.
  When, however, a stable salt-pair is in its transition interval (p.&nbsp;<a
  href="#page315">315</a>), a third salt&mdash;in this case barium
  chloride&mdash;will be deposited, as we have already learned. On bringing
  barium chloride and sodium nitrite together with water, therefore, three
  solid phases are obtained, viz. BaCl<sub>2</sub>, NaCl,
  Ba(NO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. These three phases, together with
  solution and vapour, constitute a univariant system, so that at each
  temperature the composition of the solution must be constant.</p>

  <p>Witt and Ludwig found that the presence of solid barium chloride can
  be prevented by adding an excess of sodium nitrite, as can be readily
  foreseen from what has been said. Since the solution in presence of the
  three solid phases must have a definite composition at a definite
  temperature, the addition of sodium nitrite to the solution must have, as
  its consequence, the solution of an equivalent amount of barium chloride,
  and the deposition of an equivalent amount of sodium chloride and barium
  nitrite. By sufficient addition of sodium nitrite, the complete
  disappearance of the solid barium chloride can be effected, and there
  will remain only the stable salt-pair sodium chloride and barium nitrite.
  As was pointed out by Meyerhoffer, however, the disappearance of the
  barium chloride is effected, not by a change in the <!-- Page 328
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page328"></a>{328}</span>composition of
  the solution, but by the necessity for the composition of the solution
  remaining constant.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:36%;">
      <a href="images/fig128.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig128.png"

  <p><b>Barium Carbonate and Potassium Sulphate.</b>&mdash;As has been
  found by Meyerhoffer,<a name="NtA397" href="#Nt397"><sup>[397]</sup></a>
  these two salts form the stable pair, not only at the ordinary
  temperature, but also at the melting point. For the ordinary temperatures
  this was proved in the following manner: A solution with the solid phases
  K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and
  K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O in excess can only coexist in
  contact either with BaCO<sub>3</sub> or with BaSO<sub>4</sub>, since,
  evidently, in one of the two groups the stable system must be present.
  Two solutions were prepared, each with excess of
  K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> +
  K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O, <!-- Page 329 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page329"></a>{329}</span>and to one was added
  BaCO<sub>3</sub> and to the other BaSO<sub>4</sub>. After stirring for a
  few days, the barium sulphate was completely transformed to
  BaCO<sub>3</sub>, whereas the barium carbonate remained unchanged.
  Consequently, BaCO<sub>3</sub> + K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> +
  K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O is stable, and, therefore, so
  also is BaCO<sub>3</sub> + K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. That
  BaCO<sub>3</sub> + K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> is the stable pair also at
  the melting point was proved by a special analytical method which allows
  of the detection of K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> in a mixture of the four
  solid salts. This analysis showed that a mixture of BaCO<sub>3</sub> +
  K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, after being fused and allowed to solidify,
  contains only small amounts of K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>; and this is
  due entirely to the fact that BaCO<sub>3</sub> +
  K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> on fusion deposits a little BaSO<sub>4</sub>,
  thereby giving rise at the same time to the separation of an equivalent
  amount of K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>.</p>

  <p>The different solubilities are shown in Fig. 128. In this diagram the
  solubility of the two barium salts has been neglected. A is the
  solubility of K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O; addition of
  BaCO<sub>3</sub> does not alter this. B is the solubility of
  K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O + K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
  + BaCO<sub>3</sub>. A and B almost coincide, since the potassium sulphate
  is very slightly soluble in the concentrated solution of potassium
  carbonate. D gives the concentration of the solution in equilibrium with
  K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + BaSO<sub>4</sub>. The most interesting
  point is C. This solution is obtained by adding a small quantity of water
  to BaCO<sub>3</sub> + K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, whereupon, being in
  the transition interval, BaSO<sub>4</sub> separates out and an equivalent
  amount of K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> goes into solution. C is the end
  point of the curve CO, which is called the Guldberg-Waage curve, because
  these investigators determined several points on it.</p>

  <p>In their experiments, Guldberg and Waage found the ratio
  K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> : K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> in solution to
  be constant and equal to 4. This result is, however, not exact, for the
  curve CO is not a straight line, as it should be if the above ratio were
  constant; but it is concave to the abscissa axis, and more so at lower
  than at higher temperatures.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX</h3>

<p class="cenhead">EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF THE
TRANSITION POINT</p>

  <p>For the purpose of determining the transition temperature, a number of
  methods have been employed, and the most important of these will be
  briefly described here. In any given case it is sometimes possible to
  employ more than one method, but all are not equally suitable, and the
  values of the transition point obtained by the different methods are not
  always identical. Indeed, a difference of several degrees in the value
  found may quite well occur.<a name="NtA398"
  href="#Nt398"><sup>[398]</sup></a> In each case, therefore, some care
  must be taken to select the method most suitable for the purpose.</p>

  <p><b>I. The Dilatometric Method.</b>&mdash;Since, in the majority of
  cases, transformation at the transition point is accompanied by an
  appreciable change of volume, it is only necessary to ascertain the
  temperature at which this change of volume occurs, in order to determine
  the transition point. For this purpose the <i>dilatometer</i> is
  employed, an apparatus which consists of a bulb with capillary tube
  attached, and which constitutes a sort of large thermometer (Fig. 129).
  Some of the substance to be examined is passed into the bulb A through
  the tube B, which is then sealed off. The rest of the bulb and a small
  portion of the capillary tube is then filled with some liquid, which, of
  course, must be without chemical action on the substance under
  investigation. A liquid, however, may be employed which dissolves the
  substance, for, as we have seen (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page70">70</a>), the
  transformation at the transition point is, as a rule, accelerated by the
  presence of a solvent. On the other hand, the liquid must not dissolve in
  the substance under examination, for the temperature of transformation
  would be thereby altered.</p>

<p><!-- Page 332 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page332"></a>{332}</span></p>

  <p>In using the dilatometer, two methods of procedure may be followed.
  According to the first method, the dilatometer containing the form stable
  at lower temperatures is placed in a thermostat, maintained at a constant
  temperature, until it has taken the temperature of the bath. The height
  of the meniscus is then read on a millimetre scale attached to the
  capillary. The temperature of the thermostat is then raised degree by
  degree, and the height of the meniscus at each point ascertained. If,
  now, no change takes place in the solid, the expansion will be
  practically uniform, or the rise in the level of the meniscus per degree
  of temperature will be practically the same at the different
  temperatures, as represented diagrammatically by the line AB in Fig. 130.
  On passing through the transition point, however, there will be a more or
  less sudden increase in the rise of the meniscus per degree (line BC) if
  the specific volume of the form stable at higher temperatures is greater
  than that of the original modification; thereafter, the expansion will
  again be uniform (line CD). Similarly, on cooling, contraction will at
  first be uniform and then at the transition point there will be a
  relatively large diminution of volume.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:6%;">
      <a href="images/fig129.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig129.png"
      alt="Fig. 129" title="Fig. 129" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 129.
  </div>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:25%;">
      <a href="images/fig130.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig130.png"
      alt="Fig. 130" title="Fig. 130" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 130.
  </div>

  <p>If, now, transformation occurred immediately the transition point was
  reached, the sudden expansion and contraction would take place at the
  same temperature. It is, however, generally found that there is a lag,
  and that with rising temperature the relatively large expansion does not
  take place until a temperature somewhat higher than the transition point;
  and with falling temperature the contraction occurs at a temperature
  somewhat below the transition point. This is represented in Fig. 130 by
  the lines BC and EF. The amount of lag will vary from case to case, and
  will <!-- Page 333 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page333"></a>{333}</span>also depend on the length of time during
  which the dilatometer is maintained at constant temperature.</p>

  <p>As an example, there may be given the results obtained in the
  determination of the transition point at which sodium sulphate and
  magnesium sulphate form astracanite (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page268">268</a>).<a
  name="NtA399" href="#Nt399"><sup>[399]</sup></a> The dilatometer was
  charged with a mixture of the two sulphates.</p>

</table>

  <p>The transition point, therefore, lies about 21.6° (p.&nbsp;<a
  href="#page268">268</a>).</p>

  <p>The second method of manipulation depends on the fact that, while
  above or below the transition point transformation of one form into the
  other can take place, at the transition point the two forms undergo no
  change. The bulb of the dilatometer is, therefore, charged with a mixture
  of the stable and metastable forms and a suitable liquid, and is then
  immersed in a bath at constant temperature. After the temperature of the
  bath has been acquired, readings of the height of the meniscus are made
  from time to time to ascertain whether expansion or contraction occurs.
  If expansion is found, the temperature of the thermostat is altered until
  a temperature is obtained at which a gradual contraction takes place. The
  transition point must then lie between these two temperatures; and by
  repeating the determinations it will be possible to reduce the difference
  between the temperatures at which expansion and contraction take place
  to, say, 1°, and to fix the temperature of the transition point,
  therefore, to within half a degree. By this method the transition point,
  for example, of sulphur was found to be 95.6° under a pressure of 4
  atm.<a name="NtA400" href="#Nt400"><sup>[400]</sup></a> The following are
  the figures obtained by Reicher, who used a mixture <!-- Page 334

  carbon disulphide (solvent for sulphur) and 5 parts of turpentine as the

  <p>At a temperature of 95.1° there is a contraction, <i>i.e.</i>
  monoclinic sulphur passes into the rhombic, the specific volume of the
  former being greater than that of the latter. At 96.1°, however, there is
  expansion, showing that at this temperature rhombic sulphur passes into
  monoclinic; while at 95.6° there is neither expansion nor contraction.
  This is, therefore, the transition temperature; and since the dilatometer
  was sealed up to prevent evaporation of the liquid, the pressure within
  it was 4 atm.</p>

  <p><b>II. Measurement of the Vapour Pressure.</b>&mdash;In the preceding
  pages it has been seen repeatedly that the vapour pressures of the two
  systems undergoing reciprocal transformation become identical at the
  transition point (more strictly, at the triple or <!-- Page 335 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page335"></a>{335}</span>multiple point), and
  the latter can therefore be determined by ascertaining the temperature at
  which this identity of vapour pressure is established. The apparatus
  usually employed for this purpose is the Bremer-Frowein tensimeter (p.&nbsp;<a
  href="#page91">91</a>).</p>

  <p>Although this method has not as yet been applied to systems of one
  component, it has been used to a considerable extent in the case of
  systems containing water or other volatile component. An example of this
  has already been given in Glauber's salt (p.&nbsp;<a
  href="#page139">139</a>).</p>

  <p><b>III. Solubility Measurements.</b>&mdash;The temperature of the
  transition point can also be fixed by means of solubility measurements,
  for at that point the solubility of the two systems becomes identical.
  Reference has already been made to several cases in which this method was
  employed, <i>e.g.</i> ammonium nitrate (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page112">112</a>),
  Glauber's salt (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page134">134</a>), astracanite and sodium
  and magnesium sulphates (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page268">268</a>).</p>

  <p>The determinations of the solubility can be carried out in various
  ways. One of the simplest methods, which also gives sufficiently accurate
  results when the temperature is not high or when the solvent is not very
  volatile, can be carried out in the following manner. The solid substance
  is finely powdered (in order to accelerate the process of solution), and
  placed in sufficient quantity along with the solvent in a tube carefully
  closed by a glass stopper; the latter is protected by a rubber cap, such
  as a rubber finger-stall. The tube is then rotated in a thermostat, the
  temperature of which does not vary more than one or two tenths of a
  degree, until saturation is produced. The solution is withdrawn by means
  of a pipette to which a small glass tube, filled with cotton wool to act
  as a filter, is attached. The solution is then run into a weighing
  bottle, and weighed; after which the amount of solid in solution is
  determined in a suitable manner.</p>

  <p>For more accurate determinations of the solubility, especially when
  the solvent is appreciably volatile at the temperature of experiment,
  other methods are preferable. In Fig. 131 is shown the apparatus employed
  by H. Goldschmidt,<a name="NtA401" href="#Nt401"><sup>[401]</sup></a> and
  used to a considerable extent in the laboratory of van't Hoff. This
  consists essentially of three parts: <i>a</i>, a tube in which the
  solvent and salt are placed; this is closed at the foot by an
  india-rubber stopper. Through this stopper there passes the bent tube
  <i>cb</i>, which connects the tube <i>a</i> with the weighing-tube
  <i>d</i>. At <i>c</i> there is a plug of cotton wool. Tube <i>e</i> is
  open to the air. The wider portion of the tube <i>cb</i>, which passes
  through the rubber stopper in <i>a</i>, can be closed by a plug <!-- Page
  336 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page336"></a>{336}</span>attached
  to a glass rod <i>ff</i>, which passes up through a hollow Witt stirrer,
  <i>g</i>. After being fitted together, the whole apparatus is immersed in
  the thermostat. After the solution has become saturated, the stopper of
  the bent tube is raised by means of the rod <i>ff</i> and a suction-pump
  attached to the end of <i>e</i>. The solution is thereby drawn into the
  weighing-tube <i>d</i>, the undissolved salt being retained by the plug
  at <i>c</i>. The apparatus is then removed from the thermostat, tube
  <i>d</i> detached and immediately closed by a ground stopper. It is then
  carefully dried and weighed.</p>

  shown in Fig. 132.<a name="NtA402" href="#Nt402"><sup>[402]</sup></a>
  This consists of a single tube, and the stirring is effected by means of
  a glass screw.</p>

  <p>The progress of the solution towards saturation can be very well
  tested by determining the density of the solution from time to <!-- Page
  337 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page337"></a>{337}</span>time. This
  is most conveniently carried out by means of the pipette shown in Fig.
  133.<a name="NtA403" href="#Nt403"><sup>[403]</sup></a> With this pipette
  the solution can not only be removed for weighing, but the volume can be
  determined at the same time. It consists of the wide tube <i>a</i>, to
  which the graduated capillary <i>b</i>, furnished with a cap <i>c</i>, is
  attached. To the lower end of the pipette the tube <i>e</i>, with plug of
  cotton wool, can be fixed. After the pipette has been filled by sucking
  at the end of <i>b</i>, the stop-cock <i>d</i> is closed and the cap
  <i>c</i> placed on the capillary. The apparatus can then be weighed, and
  the volume of the solution be ascertained by means of the
  graduations.</p>

  <p>As has already been insisted, particular care must be paid to the
  characterization of the solid in contact with the solution.</p>

  <p><b>IV. Thermometric Method.</b>&mdash;If a substance is heated, its
  temperature will gradually rise until the melting point is reached, and
  the temperature will then remain constant until all the solid has passed
  into liquid. Similarly, if a substance which can undergo transformation
  is heated, the temperature will rise until the transition point is
  reached, and will then remain constant until complete transformation has
  taken place.</p>

  <p>This method, it will be remembered, was employed by Richards for the
  determination of the transition point of sodium sulphate decahydrate
  (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page136">136</a>). The following figures give the results
  obtained by Meyerhoffer in the case of the transformation:&mdash;</p>

<p class="cenhead">CuK<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O <a href="images/doublearrow.png"><img src="images/doublearrow.png" class="middle" style="height:2.5ex" alt="reversible arrow" /></a> CuKCl<sub>3</sub> + KCl + 2H<sub>2</sub>O</p>

  <p>the temperature being noted from minute to minute: 95°, 93°, 91.8°,
  91.7°, 92°, 92.3°, 92.4°, 92.2°, 92.2°, 92°, 90.5°, 89°, and then a rapid
  fall in the temperature. From this we see that the transition point is
  about 92.2°. It is also evident that a slight supercooling took place
  (91.7°), owing to a delay in the transformation, but that then the
  temperature rose to the transition point. This is analogous to the
  supercooling of a liquid.</p>

  <p>A similar halt in the temperature would be observed on passing from
  lower to higher temperatures; but owing to a lag in the transformation,
  the same temperature is not always obtained.</p>

<p><!-- Page 338 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page338"></a>{338}</span></p>

  <p><b>V. Optical Method.</b>&mdash;The transition point can sometimes be
  determined by noting the temperature at which some alteration in the
  appearance of the substance occurs, such as a change of colour or of the
  crystalline form. Thus mercuric iodide changes colour from red to yellow,
  and the blue quadratic crystals of copper calcium acetate change, on
  passing the transition point, into green rhombs of copper acetate and
  white needles of calcium acetate (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page260">260</a>). Or
  again, changes in the double refraction of the crystals may be also
  employed to ascertain the temperature of the transition point. These
  changes are best observed by means of a microscope.</p>

  <p>For the purpose of regulating the temperature of the substance a small
  copper air-bath is employed.<a name="NtA404"
  href="#Nt404"><sup>[404]</sup></a></p>

  <p><b>VI. Electrical Methods.</b>&mdash;Electrical methods for the
  determination of the transition point are of two kinds, based on
  measurements of conductivity or of electromotive force. Both methods are
  restricted in their application, but where applicable give very exact
  results.</p>

  <p>The former method, which has been employed in several cases, need not
  be described here. The second method, however, is of considerable
  interest and importance, and calls for special reference.<a name="NtA405"
  href="#Nt405"><sup>[405]</sup></a></p>

  <p>If two pieces, say, of zinc, connected together by a conducting wire,
  are placed in a solution of a zinc salt, <i>e.g.</i> zinc sulphate, the
  potential of the two electrodes will be the same, and no current will be
  produced in the connecting wire. If, however, the zinc electrodes are
  immersed in two solutions of <i>different</i> concentration contained in
  separate vessels, but placed in connection with one another by means of a
  bent tube filled with a conducting solution, the potentials at the
  electrodes will no longer be the same, and a current will now flow
  through the connecting wire. The direction of this current <i>in the
  cell</i> will be from the weaker to the more concentrated solution.</p>

  <p>The greater the difference in the concentration of the solutions with
  respect to zinc, the greater will be the difference of the potential at
  the two electrodes, or the greater will be the E.M.F. of the cell. When
  the concentration of the two solutions becomes the same, the E.M.F. will
  become zero, and no current will pass.</p>

  <p>It will be understood now how this method can be made use of <!-- Page
  339 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page339"></a>{339}</span>for
  determining the transition point of a salt, when we bear in mind that at
  the transition point the solubility of the two forms becomes identical.
  Thus, for example, the transition point of zinc sulphate heptahydrate
  into hexahydrate could be determined in the following manner. Tube A
  (Fig. 134) contains, say, a saturated solution of the heptahydrate along
  with some of the solid salt; tube B, a saturated solution of the
  hexahydrate along with the solid salt. The tube C is a connecting tube
  bent downwards so as to prevent the mixing of the solutions by convection
  currents. ZZ are two zinc electrodes immersed in the solution; the cell
  is placed in a thermostat and the zinc electrodes connected with a
  galvanometer. Since, now, at temperatures below the transition point the
  solubility of the hexahydrate (the metastable form) is greater than that
  of the heptahydrate, a current will be produced, flowing in the cell from
  heptahydrate to hexahydrate. As the temperature is raised towards the
  transition point, the solubilities of the two hydrates also approach, and
  the current produced will therefore become weaker, because the E.M.F. of
  the cell becomes less; and when the transition point is attained, the
  E.M.F. becomes zero, and the current ceases. If the temperature is raised
  above this, the solubility of the heptahydrate becomes greater than that
  of the hexahydrate, and a current will again be produced, but in the
  opposite direction. By noting the temperature, therefore, at which the
  current ceases, or the E.M.F. becomes zero, the transition temperature
  can be ascertained.<a name="NtA406"
  href="#Nt406"><sup>[406]</sup></a></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:17%;">
      <a href="images/fig134.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/fig134.png"
      alt="Fig. 134" title="Fig. 134" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 134.
  </div>

  <p>In the case just described, the electrodes consisted of the same metal
  as was contained in the salt. But in some cases, <i>e.g.</i> sodium
  sulphate, electrodes of the metal contained in the salt cannot be
  employed. Nevertheless, the above electrical method can be used <!-- Page
  340 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page340"></a>{340}</span>even in
  those cases, if a suitable non-polarizable mercury electrode is
  employed.<a name="NtA407" href="#Nt407"><sup>[407]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Although, as we saw, no current was produced when two pieces of zinc
  were immersed in the same solution of zinc salt, a current will be
  obtained if two different metals, or even two different modifications of
  the same metal, are employed. Thus an E.M.F. will be established when
  electrodes of grey and of white tin are immersed in the same solution of
  zinc salt, but at the transition point this E.M.F. will become zero. By
  this method Cohen determined the transition point of grey and white tin
  (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page42">42</a>).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt13" href="#NtA13">[13]</a> It may seem as if this were a
  contradiction to what was said on p.&nbsp;<a href="#page4">4</a> as to the
  effect of the addition of ammonia or hydrogen chloride to the system
  constituted by solid ammonium chloride in contact with its products of
  dissociation. There is, however, no contradiction, because in the case of
  ammonium chloride the gaseous phase consists of ammonia and hydrogen
  chloride in equal proportions, and in adding ammonia or hydrogen chloride
  alone we are not adding the gaseous phase, but only a constituent of it.
  Addition of ammonia and hydrogen chloride together in the proportions in
  which they are combined to form ammonium chloride would cause no change
  in the equilibrium.</p>

  grades of rigidity have been realized between the ordinary solid and the
  liquid state, in the case both of crystalline and amorphous substances,
  it has been proposed to abandon the terms "solid" and "liquid," and to
  class bodies as "crystalline" or "amorphous," the passage from the one
  condition to the other being discontinuous; crystalline bodies possess a
  certain regular orientation of their molecules and a directive force,
  while in amorphous bodies these are wanting (see Lehmann, <i>Annalen der
  Physik</i>, 1900 [4], <b>2.</b> 696).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt166" href="#NtA166">[166]</a> That mercury does dissolve in
  water can be argued from analogy, say, with mercury and bromonaphthalene.
  At the ordinary temperature these two liquids appear to be quite
  insoluble in one another, but at a temperature of 280° the mercury
  dissolves in appreciable quantity; for on heating a tube containing
  bromonaphthalene over mercury the latter sublimes <i>through</i> the
  liquid bromonaphthalene and condenses on the upper surface of the

  curve will <i>intersect</i>, (<i>e.g.</i> pyridine and methyl iodide;

  be the bend. (See Stortenbeker, <i>Zeitschr. physikal. Chem.</i>, 1892,

  <p><a name="Nt249" href="#NtA249">[249]</a> The diminution of volume is

  surface tension, the behaviour of adsorbed substances is similar to that
  of substances existing in solid solutions.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt285" href="#NtA285">[285]</a> Reference may be made here to
  the term "stability limit," introduced by Knorr (<i>Annalen</i>, 1896,
  <b>293</b>. 88) to indicate that temperature above which liquefaction and
  isomeric change takes place. As employed by Knorr and others, the term
  does not appear to have a very precise meaning, since it is used to
  denote, not the temperature at which these changes can occur, but the
  temperature at which the change is rapid (vide <i>Annalen</i>, 1896,
  <b>293</b>. 91; 1899, <b>306</b>. 334); and the introduction of an
  indefinite velocity of change renders the temperature of the stability
  limit also somewhat indefinite. The definiteness of the term is also not
  a little diminished by the fact that the "limit" can be altered by means
  of catalytic agents. Since, as we have seen, the stable modification can
  always undergo isomeric change and liquefy at temperatures above the
  natural freezing point, but not below that point; and, further, the less
  stable modification can undergo isomeric transformation and liquefy at
  temperatures above the eutectic point, but will not liquefy at
  temperatures below that; it seems to the author that it would be more
  precise to identify these two points&mdash;the natural freezing point and
  the eutectic point&mdash;which are not altered by catalytic agents, with
  the "stability limits" of the stable and unstable modification
  respectively. A perfectly definite meaning would thereby be given to the
  term. In the case of those substances which do not undergo appreciable
  isomeric change at the temperature of the melting point, the stability
  limits would be the points G and H, Fig. 60.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt343" href="#NtA343">[343]</a> The influence of pressure on
  the transition point in the case of tachydrite has been determined by
  van't Hoff, Kenrick, and Dawson (<i>Zeitschr. physikal. Chem.</i>, 1901,
  <b>39</b>. 27, 34; van't Hoff, <i>Zur Bildung der ozeanischen
  Salzablagerungen</i>, I. p. 66&mdash;Brunswick, 1905). This salt is
  formed from magnesium chloride and calcium chloride at 22°, in accordance
  with the equation&mdash;</p>

<p class="cenhead">2MgCl<sub>2</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O + CaCl<sub>2</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O = Mg<sub>2</sub>CaCl<sub>6</sub>.12H<sub>2</sub>O + 6H<sub>2</sub>O</p>

  <p>Increase of pressure raises the transition point, because the
  formation of tachydrite is accompanied by increase of volume; the
  elevation being 0.016° for an increase of pressure of 1 atm. The number
  calculated from the theoretical formula (p.&nbsp;<a href="#page57">57</a>) is
  0.013° for 1 atm.</p>

  <p>If one calculates the influence of the pressure of sea-water on the
  temperature of formation of tachydrite (which is of interest on account
  of the natural occurrence of this salt), it is found that a depth of
  water of 1500 metres, exerting a pressure of 180 atm., would alter the
  temperature of formation of tachydrite by only 3°. The effect is,
  therefore, comparatively unimportant.</p>

  between reciprocal salt-pairs alone (three-component systems) is of great
  importance for the artificial preparations of minerals, as also in
  analytical chemistry for the proper understanding of the methods of
  conversion of insoluble systems into soluble by fusion (see Meyerhoffer,
